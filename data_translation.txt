Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or animals. It is also the field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. "AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go).[1]

Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[2] The field went through multiple cycles of optimism[3][4] followed by disappointment and loss of funding,[5][6] but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[7] there was a vast increase in funding and interest.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[8]
To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields.[9]

The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]

Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[10] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[11]

Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[12]
Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[13]
Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[14] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[15] scene interpretation,[16] clinical decision support,[17] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),[18] and other areas.[19]

A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by domain of knowledge.[20] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as:
objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;
[21]
situations, events, states and time;[22]
causes and effects;[23]
knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[24]
default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[25] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.

Among the most difficult problems in KR are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[26] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[13]

Knowledge acquisition is the difficult problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] Modern AI gathers knowledge by "scraping" the internet (including Wikipedia). The knowledge itself was collected by the volunteers and professionals who published the information (who may or may not have agreed to provide their work to AI companies).[29] This "crowd sourced" technique does not guarantee that the knowledge is correct or reliable. The knowledge of Large Language Models (such as Chat-GPT) is highly unreliable -- it generates misinformation and falsehoods (known as "hallucinations"). Providing accurate knowledge for these modern AI applications is an unsolved problem.

An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][30]
In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[31] In automated decision making, the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[32]

In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[33]
In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[34]
In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[35]
Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[36]
The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.

A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[37]

Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[38]

Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[39]
It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]

There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[42]
Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[43]
In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".[44]
Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[45] Deep learning uses artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.

Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[46]

Natural language processing (NLP)[47] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English.
Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[48]

Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f]
unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[26]).

Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (how often one word appears near another),[49] transformers (which finds patterns in text),[50] and others.[51] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,[52][53] and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT, GRE, and many other real-world applications.[54]

Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[55]
The field includes speech recognition,[56]
image classification,[57]
facial recognition, object recognition,[58]
and robotic perception.[59]

Robotics[60] uses AI.

Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[62]
For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.
However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[63] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[64]

A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[8]

AI research uses a wide variety of tools to accomplish the goals above.[b]

AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[65] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.

State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[66]
For example, Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[67]

Simple exhaustive searches[68]
are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[12]
"Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[69]

Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[70]

Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a numeric solution to a problem. It begins with some form of a guess and then refines the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. This process is called stochastic gradient descent.[71]

Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).[72]

Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[73]

Neural networks and statistical classifiers (discussed below), also use a form of local search, where the "landscape" to be searched is formed by learning.

Formal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[74]
Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")[75]
and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys").[76]

Logical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises).[77]
A logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference.[78]
An inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. The most general inference rule is  resolution.[79]
Inference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[80]
Inference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. No efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered.[81]

Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1 and handles uncertainty and probabilistic situations.[82]
Non-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning.[25]
Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above).

Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[83]

Bayesian networks[84]
are a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][86]
learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[h][88]
planning (using decision networks)[89]
and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90]

Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90]

Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[91]
and information value theory.[92]
These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,
[93]
dynamic decision networks,[90]
game theory and mechanism design.[94]

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. Classifiers[95]
are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[43]

There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[96] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[97]
The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner"[98] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[99]
Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[100]

Artificial neural networks[100] were inspired by the design of the human brain: a simple "neuron" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or "fired"), casts a weighted "vote" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. In practice, the input "neurons" are a list of numbers, the "weights" are a matrix, the next layer is the dot product (i.e., several weighted sums) scaled by an increasing function, such as the logistic function. "The resemblance to real neural cells and structures is superficial", according to Russell and Norvig.  [101][i]

Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[102]
Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[103]

In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[104]
Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows  short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[105]
Perceptrons[106]
use only a single layer of neurons, deep learning[107] uses multiple layers.
Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are "close" to each other – this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an "edge" before the network can identify an object.[108]

Deep learning[107]
uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[110]

Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[111]
and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[112]
The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[j]
but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[k]

In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow  software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[121]
Historically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, and others, had been used.

AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search),
targeting online advertisements,[122]
recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon),
driving internet traffic,[123][124]
targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook),
virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),[125]
autonomous vehicles (including drones,
ADAS and self-driving cars),
automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate),
facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace) and
image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok).

There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes.[126]
A few examples are energy storage,[127]
medical diagnosis,
military logistics,
applications that predict the result of judicial decisions,[128]
foreign policy,[129]
or supply chain management.

Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[130] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[131]
In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[132] Then it defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.[133][134][135] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[l] and Cepheus.[137] DeepMind in the 2010s developed a "generalized artificial intelligence" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.[138]

In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. ChatGPT, based on GPT-3, and other large language models, were tried by 14% of Americans adults.[139] The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion[140][141] sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat,[142] the fictional arrest of Donald Trump,[143] and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon,[144] as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[145][146]

AlphaFold 2 (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[147]

AI, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else".[148] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[149]

Machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data.[150]
The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[151]
Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[152][150] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[153]
Fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of academic study within AI. Researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define "fairness" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.[154]

On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[155] a problem called "sample size disparity".[156] Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a  "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[157]

COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.
In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different -- the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[158] In 2017, several researchers[m] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[160]

A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".[161]
Moritz Hardt said “the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.”[162]

Criticism of COMPAS highlighted a deeper problem with the misuse of AI. Machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. Unfortunately, if an applications then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.[163] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.[n]

Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[156]

At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[165]

Most modern AI applications can not explain how they have reached a decision.[166] The large amount of relationships between inputs and outputs in deep neural networks and resulting complexity makes it difficult for even an expert to explain how they produced their outputs, making them a black box.[167]

There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example,  Justin Ko and Roberto Novoa developed a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals, however it classified any image with a ruler as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[168] A more dangerous example was discovered by Rich Caruana in 2015: a machine learning system that accurately predicted risk of death classified a patient that was over 65, asthma and difficulty breathing as "low risk". Further research showed that in high-risk cases like this, the hospital would allocate more resources and save the patient's life, decreasing the risk measured by the program.[169] Mistakes like these become obvious when we know how the program has reached a decision. Without an explanation, these problems may not not be discovered until after they have caused harm.

A second issue is that people who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make.[170] Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[o] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[171]

DARPA established the XAI ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.[172]

There are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[173] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[174] Supersparse linear integer models use learning to identify the most important features, rather than the classification. Simple addition of these features can then make the classification (i.e. learning is used to create a scoring system classifier, which is transparent).[175]

A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[p] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[177] These weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they kill an innocent person it is not clear who should be held accountable, it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[178] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the  United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[179]

AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.[180]

Terrorists, criminals and rogue states can use weaponized AI such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons.

Machine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[181]

From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [182]

Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[183]

In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.[184] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[185] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".[q][187] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment (as opposed to redundancies).[183]

Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".[188] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[189]

In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[190][191]

In order to leverage as large a dataset as is feasible, generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".[192]

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[193]

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[194]
The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[194]
and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[195]

Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"[196]
and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[197]

The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[198]
The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[199] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[200][201]
Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[202]
Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[202]
The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[202] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[203] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[204]

In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks".[200] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[205] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41% thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding "not very important" and 8% responding "not at all important".[206][207]

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[208] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".[r][210] The first paper later recognized as "AI" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons" in 1943.[211]

The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][2] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][3]

By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[215] and laboratories had been established around the world.[216] Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".[217] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".[218]

They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[220] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[221] The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[5]

In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[222] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[4] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[6]

Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.[223] A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.[224] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x]. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[83][229] But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[230] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[231]

AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[232]
By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence".[233]

Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[8]

Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[7]
For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y]
Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[235] graphics processing units, cloud computing[236])
and access to large amounts of data[237] (including curated datasets,[236] such as ImageNet).

Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z]
The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019,[202]
and WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents[238]
According to 'AI Impacts', about $50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI";[239]
about 800,000 "AI"-related US job openings existed in 2022.[240]

In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[241]

Alan Turing wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"[242]
He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".[242]
He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[243] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[aa] but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks"[244]

Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of "acting" and not "thinking".[245] However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. "Aeronautical engineering texts," they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'"[246] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".[247]

McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world."[248] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as "the ability to solve hard problems".[249] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.

Another definition has been adopted by Google[250][better source needed], a major practitioner in the field of AI.
This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.

No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[ab] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.

Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI")[252] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."[253]

However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.[254]
Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[255]
Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree.[ac][13]

The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[257][258] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.

"Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,[259]
but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.

Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[12] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 80s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.

AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[260][261]
General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.

The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that "[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."[262] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.

David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.[263] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[264]

Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[265]

Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."[ad]
Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.[269]

If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights.[270]
Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.[271]
This issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,[272]
and is now being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.[273]

A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[261]

If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "intelligence explosion" and Vernor Vinge called a "singularity".[274]
However, most technologies do not improve exponentially indefinitely, but rather follow an S-curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[275] Consider, for example, transportation: it experienced exponential improvement from 1830 to 1970, but the trend abruptly stopped when it reached physical limits.

It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as the physicist Stephen Hawking puts it, "spell the end of the human race".[276] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character.[ae] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.

First, AI does not require human-like "sentience" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[278] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."[279] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".[280]

Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[281]

The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[282] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.[283] 
In the early 2010's, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research, or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[284] 
However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[241]
In 2023, AI pioneers including Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman issued the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war"; some others such as Yann LeCun consider this to be unfounded.[285]

Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[286]

Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.[287]

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[288]
and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[289]

A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[290]

Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[291]
while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[292]

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[293]

Computer security, cyber security, digital security or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.[1][2]

The field is significant due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet,[3] and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Also, due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT). Cybersecurity is one of the most significant challenges of the contemporary world, due to both the complexity of information systems and the societies they support. Security is of especially high importance for systems that govern large-scale systems with far-reaching physical effects, such as power distribution, elections, and finance.[4][5]

Since the Internet's arrival and with the digital transformation initiated in recent years, the notion of cybersecurity has become a familiar subject in both our professional and personal lives. Cybersecurity and cyber threats have been consistently present for the last 60 years of technological change. In the 1970s and 1980s, computer security was mainly limited to academia until the conception of the Internet, where, with increased connectivity, computer viruses and network intrusions began to take off. After the spread of viruses in the 1990s, the 2000s marked the institutionalization[clarification needed] of cyber threats and cybersecurity.

The April 1967 session organized by Willis Ware at the Spring Joint Computer Conference, and the later publication of the Ware Report, were foundational moments in the history of the field of computer security.[6] Ware's work straddled the intersection of material, cultural, political, and social concerns.[6]

A 1977 NIST publication[7] introduced the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability as a clear and simple way to describe key security goals.[8] While still relevant, many more elaborate frameworks have since been proposed.[9][10]

However, in the 1970s and 1980s, there were no grave computer threats because computers and the internet were still developing, and security threats were easily identifiable. More often, threats came from malicious insiders who gained unauthorized access to sensitive documents and files. Although malware and network breaches existed during the early years, they did not use them for financial gain. By the second half of the 1970s, established computer firms like IBM started offering commercial access control systems and computer security software products.[11]

One of the earliest examples of an attack on a computer network was the computer worm Creeper written by Bob Thomas at BBN, which propagated through the ARPANET in 1971. The program was purely experimental in nature and carried no malicious payload. A later program, Reaper, was created by Ray Tomlinson in 1972 and used to destroy Creeper.

Between September 1986 and June 1987, a group of German hackers performed the first documented case of cyber espionage. The group hacked into American defense contractors, universities, and military base networks and sold gathered information to the Soviet KGB. The group was led by Markus Hess, who was arrested on 29 June, 1987. He was convicted of espionage (along with two co-conspirators) on 15 Feb 1990.

In 1988, one of the first computer worms, called the Morris worm, was distributed via the Internet. It gained significant mainstream media attention.

In 1993, Netscape started developing the protocol SSL, shortly after the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) launched Mosaic 1.0, the first web browser, in 1993. Netscape had SSL version 1.0 ready in 1994, but it was never released to the public due to many serious security vulnerabilities. These weaknesses included replay attacks and a vulnerability that allowed hackers to alter unencrypted communications sent by users. However, in February 1995, Netscape launched Version 2.0.

The National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for the protection of U.S. information systems and also for collecting foreign intelligence.[12]

The agency analyzes commonly used software in order to find security flaws, which it reserves for offensive purposes against competitors of the United States. The agency seldom takes defensive action by reporting the flaws to software producers so that they can eliminate them.[13]

NSA contractors created and sold click-and-shoot attack tools to US agencies and close allies, but eventually, the tools made their way to foreign adversaries. In 2016, NSAs own hacking tools were hacked, and they have been used by Russia and North Korea.  NSA's employees and contractors have been recruited at high salaries by adversaries, anxious to compete in cyberwarfare. In 2007, the United States and Israel began exploiting security flaws in the Microsoft Windows operating system to attack and damage equipment used in Iran to refine nuclear materials. Iran responded by heavily investing in their own cyberwarfare capability, which it began using against the United States.[13]

A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation, or internal control. Most of the vulnerabilities that have been discovered are documented in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database.[14] An exploitable vulnerability is one for which at least one working attack or exploit exists.[15] Vulnerabilities can be researched, reverse-engineered, hunted, or exploited using automated tools or customized scripts.[16][17] To secure a computer system, it is important to understand the attacks that can be made against it, and these threats can typically be classified into one of these categories below:

A backdoor in a computer system, a cryptosystem, or an algorithm, is any secret method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls. They may exist for many reasons, including original design or poor configuration. They may have been added by an authorized party to allow some legitimate access, or by an attacker for malicious reasons; but regardless of the motives for their existence, they create a vulnerability.  Backdoors can be very hard to detect, and backdoors are usually discovered by someone who has access to the application source code or intimate knowledge of the operating system of the computer.

Denial of service attacks (DoS) are designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.[18] Attackers can deny service to individual victims, such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim's account to be locked, or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once. While a network attack from a single IP address can be blocked by adding a new firewall rule, many forms of Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are possible, where the attack comes from a large number of points – and defending is much more difficult. Such attacks can originate from the zombie computers of a botnet or from a range of other possible techniques, including distributed reflective denial of service (DRDoS), where innocent systems are fooled into sending traffic to the victim. With such attacks, the amplification factor makes the attack easier for the attacker because they have to use little bandwidth themselves[citation needed].

An unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer is most likely able to directly copy data from it. They may also compromise security by making operating system modifications, installing software worms, keyloggers, covert listening devices or using wireless microphones. Even when the system is protected by standard security measures, these may be bypassed by booting another operating system or tool from a CD-ROM or other bootable media. Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module are designed to prevent these attacks.

Eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private computer conversation (communication), typically between hosts on a network. For instance, programs such as Carnivore and NarusInSight have been used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and NSA to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers. Even machines that operate as a closed system (i.e., with no contact with the outside world) can be eavesdropped upon by monitoring the faint electromagnetic transmissions generated by the hardware. TEMPEST is a specification by the NSA referring to these attacks.

Surfacing in 2017, a new class of multi-vector,[19] polymorphic[20] cyber threats combined several types of attacks and changed form to avoid cybersecurity controls as they spread.

Phishing is the attempt of acquiring sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details directly from users by deceiving the users.[21] Phishing is typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. The fake website often asks for personal information, such as login details and passwords. This information can then be used to gain access to the individual's real account on the real website. Preying on a victim's trust, phishing can be classified as a form of social engineering.  Attackers are using creative ways to gain access to real accounts.  A common scam is for attackers to send fake electronic invoices[22] to individuals showing that they recently purchased music, apps, or others, and instructing them to click on a link if the purchases were not authorized. A more strategic type of phishing is spear-phishing which leverages personal or organization-specific details to make the attacker appear like a trusted source. Spear-phishing attacks target specific individuals, rather than the broad net cast by phishing attempts.[23]

Privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker with some level of restricted access is able to, without authorization, elevate their privileges or access level. For example, a standard computer user may be able to exploit a vulnerability in the system to gain access to restricted data; or even become root and have full unrestricted access to a system.

Reverse engineering is the process by which a man-made object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, code, and architecture, or to extract knowledge from the object; similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon.[24]: 3 

Any computational system affects its environment in some form. This effect it has on its environment includes a wide range of criteria, which can range from electromagnetic radiation to residual effect on RAM cells which as a consequence make a Cold boot attack possible, to hardware implementation faults that allow for access and or guessing of other values that normally should be inaccessible. In Side-channel attack scenarios, the attacker would gather such information about a system or network to guess its internal state and as a result access the information which is assumed by the victim to be secure.

Social engineering, in the context of computer security, aims to convince a user to disclose secrets such as passwords, card numbers, etc. or grant physical access by, for example, impersonating a senior executive, bank, a contractor, or a customer.[25] This generally involves exploiting people's trust, and relying on their cognitive biases. A common scam involves emails sent to accounting and finance department personnel, impersonating their CEO and urgently requesting some action. In early 2016, the FBI reported that such business email compromise (BEC) scams had cost US businesses more than $2 billion in about two years.[26]

In May 2016, the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team was the victim of this type of cyber scam with a perpetrator impersonating the team's president Peter Feigin, resulting in the handover of all the team's employees' 2015 W-2 tax forms.[27]

Spoofing is an act of masquerading as a valid entity through the falsification of data (such as an IP address or username), in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.[28][29] There are several types of spoofing, including:

In 2018, the cybersecurity firm Trellix published research on the life-threatening risk of spoofing in the healthcare industry.[31]

Tampering describes a malicious modification or alteration of data. An intentional but unauthorized act resulting in the modification of a system, components of systems, its intended behavior, or data. So-called Evil Maid attacks and security services planting of surveillance capability into routers are examples.[32]

Malicious software (malware) installed on a computer can leak any information, such as personal information, business information and passwords, can give control of the system to the attacker, and can corrupt or delete data permanently.[33]

HTML files can carry payloads concealed as benign, inert data in order to defeat content filters. These payloads can be reconstructed on the other side of the filter.[34]

Employee behavior can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness toward information security within an organization. Information security culture is the "...totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contributes to the protection of information of all kinds."[35]

Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of their organization's information security effort and often take actions that impede organizational changes.[36] Indeed, the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2020, which examined 3,950 security breaches, discovered 30% of cybersecurity incidents involved internal actors within a company.[37] Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In "Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change", authors commented, "It's a never-ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance." To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.[38]

The growth in the number of computer systems and the increasing reliance upon them by individuals, businesses, industries, and governments means that there are an increasing number of systems at risk.

The computer systems of financial regulators and financial institutions like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SWIFT, investment banks, and commercial banks are prominent hacking targets for cybercriminals interested in manipulating markets and making illicit gains.[39] Websites and apps that accept or store credit card numbers, brokerage accounts, and bank account information are also prominent hacking targets, because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money, making purchases, or selling the information on the black market.[40] In-store payment systems and ATMs have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and PINs.

The UCLA Internet Report: Surveying the Digital Future (2000) found that the privacy of personal data created barriers to online sales and that more than nine out of 10 internet users were somewhat or very concerned about credit card security.[41]

The most common web technologies for improving security between browsers and websites are named SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security), identity management and authentication services, and domain name services allow companies and consumers to engage in secure communications and commerce. Several versions of SSL and TLS are commonly used today in applications such as web browsing, e-mail, internet faxing, instant messaging, and VoIP (voice-over-IP). There are various interoperable implementations of these technologies, including at least one implementation that is  open source. Open source allows anyone to view the application's source code, and look for and report vulnerabilities.

The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard cooperated to develop the secure EMV chip which is embedded in credit cards. Further developments include the Chip Authentication Program where banks give customers hand-held card readers to perform online secure transactions. Other developments in this arena include the development of technology such as Instant Issuance which has enabled shopping mall kiosks acting on behalf of banks to issue on-the-spot credit cards to interested customers.

Computers control functions at many utilities, including coordination of telecommunications, the power grid, nuclear power plants, and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks. The Internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected, but the Stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the Internet can be vulnerable. In 2014, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, investigated 79 hacking incidents at energy companies.[42]

The aviation industry is very reliant on a series of complex systems which could be attacked.[43] A simple power outage at one airport can cause repercussions worldwide,[44] much of the system relies on radio transmissions which could be disrupted,[45] and controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends 175 to 225 miles offshore.[46] There is also potential for attack from within an aircraft.[47]

In Europe, with the (Pan-European Network Service)[48] and NewPENS,[49] and in the US with the NextGen program,[50] air navigation service providers are moving to create their own dedicated networks.

Many modern passports are now biometric passports, containing an embedded microchip that stores a digitized photograph and personal information such as name, gender, and date of birth. In addition, more countries[which?] are introducing facial recognition technology to reduce identity-related fraud. The introduction of the ePassport has assisted border officials in verifying the identity of the passport holder, thus allowing for quick passenger processing.[51] Plans are under way in the US, the UK, and Australia to introduce SmartGate kiosks with both retina and fingerprint recognition technology.[52] The airline industry is moving from the use of traditional paper tickets towards the use of electronic tickets (e-tickets). These have been made possible by advances in online credit card transactions in partnership with the airlines. Long-distance bus companies[which?] are also switching over to e-ticketing transactions today.

The consequences of a successful attack range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity, air traffic control outages, loss of aircraft, and even loss of life.

Desktop computers and laptops are commonly targeted to gather passwords or financial account information or to construct a botnet to attack another target. Smartphones, tablet computers, smart watches, and other mobile devices such as quantified self devices like activity trackers have sensors such as cameras, microphones, GPS receivers, compasses, and accelerometers which could be exploited, and may collect personal information, including sensitive health information. WiFi, Bluetooth, and cell phone networks on any of these devices could be used as attack vectors, and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful breach.[53]

The increasing number of home automation devices such as the Nest thermostat are also potential targets.[53]

Today many health-care providers and health insurance companies use the internet to provide enhanced products and services, for example through use of tele-health to potentially offer better quality and access to healthcare, or fitness trackers to lower insurance premiums.

The health care company Humana partners with WebMD, Oracle Corporation, EDS and Microsoft to enable its members to access their health care records, as well as to provide an overview of health care plans.[54] Patient records are increasingly being placed on secure in-house networks, alleviating the need for extra storage space.[55]

Large corporations are common targets. In many cases attacks are aimed at financial gain through identity theft and involve data breaches. Examples include the loss of millions of clients' credit card and financial details by Home Depot,[56] Staples,[57] Target Corporation,[58] and Equifax.[59]

Medical records have been targeted in general identify theft, health insurance fraud, and impersonating patients to obtain prescription drugs for recreational purposes or resale.[60] Although cyber threats continue to increase, 62% of all organizations did not increase security training for their business in 2015.[61]

Not all attacks are financially motivated, however: security firm HBGary Federal had a serious series of attacks in 2011 from hacktivist group Anonymous in retaliation for the firm's CEO claiming to have infiltrated their group,[62][63] and Sony Pictures was hacked in 2014 with the apparent dual motive of embarrassing the company through data leaks and crippling the company by wiping workstations and servers.[64][65]

Vehicles are increasingly computerized, with engine timing, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, seat belt tensioners, door locks, airbags and advanced driver-assistance systems on many models. Additionally, connected cars may use WiFi and Bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices and the cell phone network.[66] Self-driving cars are expected to be even more complex. All of these systems carry some security risks, and such issues have gained wide attention.[67][68][69]

Simple examples of risk include a malicious compact disc being used as an attack vector,[70] and the car's onboard microphones being used for eavesdropping. However, if access is gained to a car's internal controller area network, the danger is much greater[66] – and in a widely publicized 2015 test, hackers remotely carjacked a vehicle from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditch.[71][72]

Manufacturers are reacting in numerous ways, with Tesla in 2016 pushing out some security fixes over the air into its cars' computer systems.[73] In the area of autonomous vehicles, in September 2016 the United States Department of Transportation announced some initial safety standards, and called for states to come up with uniform policies.[74][75][76]

Additionally, e-Drivers’ licenses are being developed using the same technology. For example, Mexico’s licensing authority (ICV) has used a smart card platform to issue the first e-Drivers’ licenses to the city of Monterrey, in the state of Nuevo León.[77]

Shipping companies[78] have adopted RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology as an efficient, digitally secure, tracking device. Unlike a barcode, RFID can be read up to 20 feet away. RFID is used by FedEx[79] and UPS.[80]

Government and military computer systems are commonly attacked by activists[81][82][83] and foreign powers.[84][85][86][87] Local and regional government infrastructure such as traffic light controls, police and intelligence agency communications, personnel records, as well as student records.[88]

The FBI, CIA, and Pentagon, all utilize secure controlled access technology for any of their buildings. However, the use of this form of technology is spreading into the entrepreneurial world. More and more companies are taking advantage of the development of digitally secure controlled access technology. GE's ACUVision, for example, offers a single panel platform for access control, alarm monitoring and digital recording.[89]

The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical objects such as devices, vehicles, and buildings that are embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data.[90] Concerns have been raised that this is being developed without appropriate consideration of the security challenges involved.[91][92]

While the IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,[93][94]
it also provides opportunities for misuse. In particular, as the Internet of Things spreads widely, cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat.[95] If a front door's lock is connected to the Internet, and can be locked/unlocked from a phone, then a criminal could enter the home at the press of a button from a stolen or hacked phone. People could stand to lose much more than their credit card numbers in a world controlled by IoT-enabled devices. Thieves have also used electronic means to circumvent non-Internet-connected hotel door locks.[96]

An attack that targets physical infrastructure and/or human lives is sometimes referred to as a cyber-kinetic attack. As IoT devices and appliances gain currency, cyber-kinetic attacks can become pervasive and significantly damaging.

Medical devices have either been successfully attacked or had potentially deadly vulnerabilities demonstrated, including both in-hospital diagnostic equipment[97] and implanted devices including pacemakers[98] and insulin pumps.[99] There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked, including ransomware attacks,[100][101][102][103] Windows XP exploits,[104][105] viruses,[106][107] and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers.[108][101][109][110] On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internet-connected devices – but no structure for enforcement.[111][112]

In distributed generation systems, the risk of a cyber attack is real, according to Daily Energy Insider. An attack could cause a loss of power in a large area for a long period of time, and such an attack could have just as severe consequences as a natural disaster. The District of Columbia is considering creating a Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Authority within the city, with the goal being for customers to have more insight into their own energy use and giving the local electric utility, Pepco, the chance to better estimate energy demand. The D.C. proposal, however, would "allow third-party vendors to create numerous points of energy distribution, which could potentially create more opportunities for cyber attackers to threaten the electric grid."[113]

Perhaps the most widely known digitally secure telecommunication device is the SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, a device that is embedded in most of the world’s cellular devices before any service can be obtained. The SIM card is just the beginning of this digitally secure environment.

The Smart Card Web Servers draft standard (SCWS) defines the interfaces to an HTTP server in a smart card.[114] Tests are being conducted to secure OTA ("over-the-air") payment and credit card information from and to a mobile phone. 
Combination SIM/DVD devices are being developed through Smart Video Card technology which embeds a DVD-compliant optical disc into the card body of a regular SIM card.

Other telecommunication developments involving digital security include mobile signatures, which use the embedded SIM card to generate a legally binding electronic signature.

Serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches, but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident, the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved. "Several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general. The 2003 loss estimates by these firms range from $13 billion (worms and viruses only) to $226 billion (for all forms of covert attacks). The reliability of these estimates is often challenged; the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal."[115]

However, reasonable estimates of the financial cost of security breaches can actually help organizations make rational investment decisions. According to the classic Gordon-Loeb Model analyzing the optimal investment level in information security, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).[116]

As with physical security, the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers. Some are thrill-seekers or vandals, some are activists, others are criminals looking for financial gain. State-sponsored attackers are now common and well resourced but started with amateurs such as Markus Hess who hacked for the KGB, as recounted by Clifford Stoll in The Cuckoo's Egg.

Additionally, recent attacker motivations can be traced back to extremist organizations seeking to gain political advantage or disrupt social agendas.[117] The growth of the internet, mobile technologies, and inexpensive computing devices have led to a rise in capabilities but also to the risk to environments that are deemed as vital to operations. All critical targeted environments are susceptible to compromise and this has led to a series of proactive studies on how to migrate the risk by taking into consideration motivations by these types of actors. Several stark differences exist between the hacker motivation and that of nation state actors seeking to attack based on an ideological preference.[118]

A standard part of threat modeling for any particular system is to identify what might motivate an attack on that system, and who might be motivated to breach it. The level and detail of precautions will vary depending on the system to be secured. A home personal computer, bank, and classified military network face very different threats, even when the underlying technologies in use are similar.[119]

In computer security, a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.[120][121][122]

Some common countermeasures are listed in the following sections:

Security by design, or alternately secure by design, means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure. In this case, security is considered a main feature.

Some of the techniques in this approach include:

The Open Security Architecture organization defines IT security architecture as "the design artifacts that describe how the security controls (security countermeasures) are positioned, and how they relate to the overall information technology architecture. These controls serve the purpose to maintain the system's quality attributes: confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and assurance services".[123]

Techopedia defines security architecture as "a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment. It also specifies when and where to apply security controls. The design process is generally reproducible." The key attributes of security architecture are:[124]

Practicing security architecture provides the right foundation to systematically address business, IT and security concerns in an organization.

A state of computer security is the conceptual ideal, attained by the use of the three processes: threat prevention, detection, and response. These processes are based on various policies and system components, which include the following:

Today, computer security consists mainly of preventive measures, like firewalls or an exit procedure. A firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network, such as the Internet, and can be implemented as software running on the machine, hooking into the network stack (or, in the case of most UNIX-based operating systems such as Linux, built into the operating system kernel) to provide real-time filtering and blocking. Another implementation is a so-called physical firewall, which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic. Firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the Internet.

Some organizations are turning to big data platforms, such as Apache Hadoop, to extend data accessibility and machine learning to detect advanced persistent threats.[126]

However, relatively few organizations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems, and fewer still have organized response mechanisms in place. As a result, as Reuters pointed out in 2010: "Companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets".[127] The primary obstacle to effective eradication of cybercrime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated detection systems. Yet it is basic evidence gathering by using packet capture appliances that puts criminals behind bars.[citation needed]

In order to ensure adequate security, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a network, better known as the CIA triad, must be protected and is considered the foundation to information security.[128] To achieve those objectives, administrative, physical and technical security measures should be employed. The amount of security afforded to an asset can only be determined when its value is known.[129]

Vulnerability management is the cycle of identifying, remediating or mitigating vulnerabilities,[130] especially in software and firmware. Vulnerability management is integral to computer security and network security.

Vulnerabilities can be discovered with a vulnerability scanner, which analyzes a computer system in search of known vulnerabilities,[131] such as open ports, insecure software configuration, and susceptibility to malware.  In order for these tools to be effective, they must be kept up to date with every new update the vendor release.  Typically, these updates will scan for the new vulnerabilities that were introduced recently.

Beyond vulnerability scanning, many organizations contract outside security auditors to run regular penetration tests against their systems to identify vulnerabilities. In some sectors, this is a contractual requirement.[132]

Information technology security assessment aims to assess systems for risk and to predict and test for their vulnerabilities.

While formal verification of the correctness of computer systems is possible,[133][134] it is not yet common. Operating systems formally verified include seL4,[135] and SYSGO's PikeOS[136][137] – but these make up a very small percentage of the market.

Two factor authentication is a method for mitigating unauthorized access to a system or sensitive information. It requires something you know; a password or PIN, and something you have; a card, dongle, cellphone, or another piece of hardware. This increases security as an unauthorized person needs both of these to gain access.

Social engineering and direct computer access (physical) attacks can only be prevented by non-computer means, which can be difficult to enforce, relative to the sensitivity of the information. Training is often involved to help mitigate this risk, but even in highly disciplined environments (e.g. military organizations), social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent.

Inoculation, derived from inoculation theory, seeks to prevent social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.[138]

It is possible to reduce an attacker's chances by keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates, using a security scanner[definition needed] and/or hiring people with expertise in security, though none of these guarantee the prevention of an attack. The effects of data loss/damage can be reduced by careful backing up and insurance.

While hardware may be a source of insecurity, such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process,[139][140] hardware-based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software-only computer security. Using devices and methods such as dongles, trusted platform modules, intrusion-aware cases, drive locks, disabling USB ports, and mobile-enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access (or sophisticated backdoor access) required in order to be compromised. Each of these is covered in more detail below.

One use of the term computer security refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems. In the 1980s, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) used the "Orange Book"[152] standards, but the current international standard ISO/IEC 15408, Common Criteria defines a number of progressively more stringent Evaluation Assurance Levels. Many common operating systems meet the EAL4 standard of being "Methodically Designed, Tested and Reviewed", but the formal verification required for the highest levels means that they are uncommon. An example of an EAL6 ("Semiformally Verified Design and Tested") system is INTEGRITY-178B, which is used in the Airbus A380[153]
and several military jets.[154]

In software engineering, secure coding aims to guard against the accidental introduction of security vulnerabilities. It is also possible to create software designed from the ground up to be secure. Such systems are secure by design. Beyond this, formal verification aims to prove the correctness of the algorithms underlying a system;[155]
important for cryptographic protocols for example.

Within computer systems, two of the main security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC).

An access-control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions associated with an object. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.

Role-based access control is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users,[156][157][158]  used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees,[159] and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

A further approach, capability-based security has been mostly restricted to research operating systems. Capabilities can, however, also be implemented at the language level, leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object-oriented design. An open-source project in the area is the E language.

The end-user is widely recognized as the weakest link in the security chain[160] and it is estimated that more than 90% of security incidents and breaches involve some kind of human error.[161][162] Among the most commonly recorded forms of errors and misjudgment are poor password management, sending emails containing sensitive data and attachments to the wrong recipient, the inability to recognize misleading URLs and to identify fake websites and dangerous email attachments.  A common mistake that users make is saving their user id/password in their browsers to make it easier to log in to banking sites.  This is a gift to attackers who have obtained access to a machine by some means.  The risk may be mitigated by the use of two-factor authentication.[163]

As the human component of cyber risk is particularly relevant in determining the global cyber risk[164] an organization is facing, security awareness training, at all levels, not only provides formal compliance with regulatory and industry mandates but is considered essential[165] in reducing cyber risk and protecting individuals and companies from the great majority of cyber threats.

The focus on the end-user represents a profound cultural change for many security practitioners, who have traditionally approached cybersecurity exclusively from a technical perspective, and moves along the lines suggested by major security centers[166] to develop a culture of cyber awareness within the organization, recognizing that a security-aware user provides an important line of defense against cyber attacks.

Related to end-user training, digital hygiene or cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and, as the analogy with personal hygiene shows, is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimize the risks from cyber threats. The assumption is that good cyber hygiene practices can give networked users another layer of protection, reducing the risk that one vulnerable node will be used to either mount attacks or compromise another node or network, especially from common cyberattacks.[167] Cyber hygiene should also not be mistaken for proactive cyber defence, a military term.[168]

As opposed to a purely technology-based defense against threats, cyber hygiene mostly regards routine measures that are technically simple to implement and mostly dependent on discipline[169] or education.[170] It can be thought of as an abstract list of tips or measures that have been demonstrated as having a positive effect on personal and/or collective digital security. As such, these measures can be performed by laypeople, not just security experts.

Cyber hygiene relates to personal hygiene as computer viruses relate to biological viruses (or pathogens). However, while the term computer virus was coined almost simultaneously with the creation of the first working computer viruses,[171] the term cyber hygiene is a much later invention, perhaps as late as 2000[172] by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf. It has since been adopted by the Congress[173] and Senate of the United States,[174] the FBI,[175] EU institutions[167] and heads of state.[168]

Responding to attempted security breaches is often very difficult for a variety of reasons, including:

Where an attack succeeds and a breach occurs, many jurisdictions now have in place mandatory security breach notification laws.

Computer security incident management is an organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a computer security incident or compromise with the goal of preventing a breach or thwarting a cyberattack. An incident that is not identified and managed at the time of intrusion typically escalates to a more damaging event such as a data breach or system failure. The intended outcome of a computer security incident response plan is to contain the incident, limit damage and assist recovery to business as usual. Responding to compromises quickly can mitigate exploited vulnerabilities, restore services and processes and minimize losses.[176]
Incident response planning allows an organization to establish a series of best practices to stop an intrusion before it causes damage. Typical incident response plans contain a set of written instructions that outline the organization's response to a cyberattack. Without a documented plan in place, an organization may not successfully detect an intrusion or compromise and stakeholders may not understand their roles, processes and procedures during an escalation, slowing the organization's response and resolution.

There are four key components of a computer security incident response plan:

Some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below.

In 1988, 60,000 computers were connected to the Internet, and most were mainframes, minicomputers and professional workstations. On 2 November 1988, many started to slow down, because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers – the first internet computer worm.[178] The software was traced back to 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student Robert Tappan Morris who said "he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the Internet".[178]

In 1994, over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the Rome Laboratory, the US Air Force's main command and research facility. Using trojan horses, hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to Rome's networking systems and remove traces of their activities. The intruders were able to obtain classified files, such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some Defense contractors, and other private sector organizations, by posing as a trusted Rome center user.[179]

In early 2007, American apparel and home goods company TJX announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion[180] and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card, debit card, check, and merchandise return transactions.[181]

In 2010, the computer worm known as Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.[182] It did so by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in a targeted attack. This is generally believed to have been launched by Israel and the United States to disrupt Iran's nuclear program[183][184][185][186] – although neither has publicly admitted this.

In early 2013, documents provided by Edward Snowden were published by The Washington Post and The Guardian[187][188] exposing the massive scale of NSA global surveillance. There were also indications that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor in a NIST standard for encryption.[189] This standard was later withdrawn due to widespread criticism.[190] The NSA additionally were revealed to have tapped the links between Google's data centers.[191]

A Ukrainian hacker known as Rescator broke into Target Corporation computers in 2013, stealing roughly 40 million credit cards,[192] and then Home Depot computers in 2014, stealing between 53 and 56 million credit card numbers.[193] Warnings were delivered at both corporations, but ignored; physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role. "The malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting," says Jim Walter, director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company McAfee – meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings. The size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and Federal United States authorities and the investigation is ongoing.

In April 2015, the Office of Personnel Management discovered it had been hacked more than a year earlier in a data breach, resulting in the theft of approximately 21.5 million personnel records handled by the office.[194] The Office of Personnel Management hack has been described by federal officials as among the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.[195] Data targeted in the breach included personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, names, dates and places of birth, addresses, and fingerprints of current and former government employees as well as anyone who had undergone a government background check.[196][197] It is believed the hack was perpetrated by Chinese hackers.[198]

In July 2015, a hacker group is known as The Impact Team successfully breached the extramarital relationship website Ashley Madison, created by Avid Life Media. The group claimed that they had taken not only company data but user data as well. After the breach, The Impact Team dumped emails from the company's CEO, to prove their point, and threatened to dump customer data unless the website was taken down permanently.[199] When Avid Life Media did not take the site offline the group released two more compressed files, one 9.7GB and the second 20GB. After the second data dump, Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman resigned; but the website remained to function.

In June 2021, the cyber attack took down the largest fuel pipeline in the U.S. and led to shortages across the East Coast.[200]

International legal issues of cyber attacks are complicated in nature. There is no global base of common rules to judge, and eventually punish, cybercrimes and cybercriminals - and where security firms or agencies do locate the cybercriminal behind the creation of a particular piece of malware or form of cyber attack, often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute.[201][202] Proving attribution for cybercrimes and cyberattacks is also a major problem for all law enforcement agencies. "Computer viruses switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another – moving around the world, using the fact that we don't have the capability to globally police operations like this. So the Internet is as if someone [had] given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world."[201] The use of techniques such as dynamic DNS, fast flux and bullet proof servers add to the difficulty of investigation and enforcement.

The role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their systems, infrastructure and information from any cyberattacks, but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national power-grid.[203]

The government's regulatory role in cyberspace is complicated. For some, cyberspace was seen as a virtual space that was to remain free of government intervention, as can be seen in many of today's libertarian blockchain and bitcoin discussions.[204]

Many government officials and experts think that the government should do more and that there is a crucial need for improved regulation, mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem. R. Clarke said during a panel discussion at the RSA Security Conference in San Francisco, he believes that the "industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If the industry doesn't respond (to the threat), you have to follow through."[205] On the other hand, executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary, but think that government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently. Daniel R. McCarthy analyzed this public-private partnership in cybersecurity and reflected on the role of cybersecurity in the broader constitution of political order.[206]

On 22 May 2020, the UN Security Council held its second ever informal meeting on cybersecurity to focus on cyber challenges to international peace. According to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, new technologies are too often used to violate rights.[207]

Many different teams and organizations exist, including:

On 14 April 2016, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR, which came into force on 25 May 2018, grants individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) the right to the protection of personal data. The regulation requires that any entity that processes personal data incorporate data protection by design and by default. It also requires that certain organizations appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO).

Most countries have their own computer emergency response team to protect network security.

Since 2010, Canada has had a cybersecurity strategy.[213][214] This functions as a counterpart document to the National Strategy and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure.[215] The strategy has three main pillars: securing government systems, securing vital private cyber systems, and helping Canadians to be secure online.[214][215] There is also a Cyber Incident Management Framework to provide a coordinated response in the event of a cyber incident.[216][217]

The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) is responsible for mitigating and responding to threats to Canada's critical infrastructure and cyber systems. It provides support to mitigate cyber threats, technical support to respond & recover from targeted cyber attacks, and provides online tools for members of Canada's critical infrastructure sectors.[218] It posts regular cybersecurity bulletins[219] & operates an online reporting tool where individuals and organizations can report a cyber incident.[220]

To inform the general public on how to protect themselves online, Public Safety Canada has partnered with STOP.THINK.CONNECT, a coalition of non-profit, private sector, and government organizations,[221] and launched the Cyber Security Cooperation Program.[222][223] They also run the GetCyberSafe portal for Canadian citizens, and Cyber Security Awareness Month during October.[224]

Public Safety Canada aims to begin an evaluation of Canada's cybersecurity strategy in early 2015.[215]

China's Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization (Chinese: 中央网络安全和信息化领导小组) was established on 27 February 2014. This Leading Small Group (LSG) of the Chinese Communist Party is headed by General Secretary Xi Jinping himself and is staffed with relevant Party and state decision-makers. The LSG was created to overcome the incoherent policies and overlapping responsibilities that characterized China's former cyberspace decision-making mechanisms. The LSG oversees policy-making in the economic, political, cultural, social and military fields as they relate to network security and IT strategy. This LSG also coordinates major policy initiatives in the international arena that promote norms and standards favored by the Chinese government and that emphasizes the principle of national sovereignty in cyberspace.[225]

Berlin starts National Cyber Defense Initiative: On 16 June 2011, the German Minister for Home Affairs, officially opened the new German NCAZ (National Center for Cyber Defense) Nationales Cyber-Abwehrzentrum located in Bonn. The NCAZ closely cooperates with BSI (Federal Office for Information Security) Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BKA (Federal Police Organisation) Bundeskriminalamt (Deutschland), BND (Federal Intelligence Service) Bundesnachrichtendienst, MAD (Military Intelligence Service) Amt für den Militärischen Abschirmdienst and other national organizations in Germany taking care of national security aspects. According to the Minister, the primary task of the new organization founded on 23 February 2011, is to detect and prevent attacks against the national infrastructure and mentioned incidents like Stuxnet. Germany has also established the largest research institution for IT security in Europe, the Center for Research in Security and Privacy (CRISP) in Darmstadt.

Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000.[226]

The National Cyber Security Policy 2013 is a policy framework by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) which aims to protect the public and private infrastructure from cyberattacks, and safeguard "information, such as personal information (of web users), financial and banking information and sovereign data". CERT- In is the nodal agency which monitors the cyber threats in the country. The post of National Cyber Security Coordinator has also been created in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).

The Indian Companies Act 2013 has also introduced cyber law and cybersecurity obligations on the part of Indian directors. Some provisions for cybersecurity have been incorporated into rules framed under the Information Technology Act 2000 Update in 2013.[227]

Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, when the government, news media, television stations, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. The South Korean government blamed its northern counterpart for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011,[228] and 2012, but Pyongyang denies the accusations.[229]

The 1986 18 U.S.C. § 1030, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the key legislation. It prohibits unauthorized access or damage of protected computers as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2). Although various other measures have been proposed[230][231] – none has succeeded.

In 2013, executive order 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was signed, which prompted the creation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

In response to the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack[232] President Joe Biden signed Executive Order 14028[233] on May 12, 2021, to increase software security standards for sales to the government, tighten detection and security on existing systems, improve information sharing and training, establish a Cyber Safety Review Board, and improve incident response.

The General Services Administration (GSA) has[when?] standardized the penetration test service as a pre-vetted support service, to rapidly address potential vulnerabilities, and stop adversaries before they impact US federal, state and local governments. These services are commonly referred to as Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS).

The Department of Homeland Security has a dedicated division responsible for the response system, risk management program and requirements for cybersecurity in the United States called the National Cyber Security Division.[234][235] The division is home to US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System.[235] The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center brings together government organizations responsible for protecting computer networks and networked infrastructure.[236]

The third priority of the FBI is to: "Protect the United States against cyber-based attacks and high-technology crimes",[237] and they, along with the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) are part of the multi-agency task force, The Internet Crime Complaint Center, also known as IC3.[238]

In addition to its own specific duties, the FBI participates alongside non-profit organizations such as InfraGard.[239][240]

The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) operates in the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division. The CCIPS is in charge of investigating computer crime and intellectual property crime and is specialized in the search and seizure of digital evidence in computers and networks.[241] In 2017, CCIPS published A Framework for a Vulnerability Disclosure Program for Online Systems to help organizations "clearly describe authorized vulnerability disclosure and discovery conduct, thereby substantially reducing the likelihood that such described activities will result in a civil or criminal violation of law under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030)."[242]

The United States Cyber Command, also known as USCYBERCOM, "has the mission to direct, synchronize, and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners."[243] It has no role in the protection of civilian networks.[244][245]

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission's role in cybersecurity is to strengthen the protection of critical communications infrastructure, to assist in maintaining the reliability of networks during disasters, to aid in swift recovery after, and to ensure that first responders have access to effective communications services.[246]

The Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance for medical devices,[247] and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration[248] is concerned with automotive cybersecurity. After being criticized by the Government Accountability Office,[249] and following successful attacks on airports and claimed attacks on airplanes, the Federal Aviation Administration has devoted funding to securing systems on board the planes of private manufacturers, and the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System.[250] Concerns have also been raised about the future Next Generation Air Transportation System.[251]

The US Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004, supplemented by DoD Directive 8140, requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology (IT) certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Andersson and Reimers (2019) report these certifications range from CompTIA's A+ and Security+ through the ICS2.org's CISSP, etc.. [252]

Computer emergency response team is a name given to expert groups that handle computer security incidents. In the US, two distinct organizations exist, although they do work closely together.

There is growing concern that cyberspace will become the next theater of warfare. As Mark Clayton from The Christian Science Monitor wrote in a 2015 article titled "The New Cyber Arms Race":

In the future, wars will not just be fought by soldiers with guns or with planes that drop bombs. They will also be fought with the click of a mouse a half a world away that unleashes carefully weaponized computer programs that disrupt or destroy critical industries like utilities, transportation, communications, and energy. Such attacks could also disable military networks that control the movement of troops, the path of jet fighters, the command and control of warships.[254]
This has led to new terms such as cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism. The United States Cyber Command was created in 2009[255] and many other countries have similar forces.

There are a few critical voices that question whether cybersecurity is as significant a threat as it is made out to be.[256][257][258]

• Protection of Sensitive Information

Both network security and cybersecurity are important for protecting sensitive information such as personal data, financial information, and trade secrets. A breach of this information can result in significant financial and reputational losses for businesses and individuals alike.

• Protection of Devices and Systems

Network security and cybersecurity are also important for protecting devices and systems from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. This is particularly important for businesses that rely on digital technologies to store and transmit sensitive data.

• Compliance with Regulations

Many industries are subject to regulatory compliance requirements, such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR, which mandate the protection of sensitive information. Compliance with these regulations requires implementing robust network security and cybersecurity measures.[23]

Cybersecurity is a fast-growing field of IT concerned with reducing organizations' risk of hack or data breaches.[259] According to research from the Enterprise Strategy Group, 46% of organizations say that they have a "problematic shortage" of cybersecurity skills in 2016, up from 28% in 2015.[260] Commercial, government and non-governmental organizations all employ cybersecurity professionals. The fastest increases in demand for cybersecurity workers are in industries managing increasing volumes of consumer data such as finance, health care, and retail.[261] However, the use of the term cybersecurity is more prevalent in government job descriptions.[262]

Typical cybersecurity job titles and descriptions include:[263]

Student programs are also available for people interested in beginning a career in cybersecurity.[268][269] Meanwhile, a flexible and effective option for information security professionals of all experience levels to keep studying is online security training, including webcasts.[270][271] A wide range of certified courses are also available.[272]

In the United Kingdom, a nationwide set of cybersecurity forums, known as the U.K Cyber Security Forum, were established supported by the Government's cybersecurity strategy[273] in order to encourage start-ups and innovation and to address the skills gap[274] identified by the U.K Government.

In Singapore, the Cyber Security Agency has issued a Singapore Operational Technology (OT) Cybersecurity Competency Framework (OTCCF). The framework defines emerging cybersecurity roles in Operational Technology. The OTCCF was endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). It outlines the different OT cybersecurity job positions as well as the technical skills and core competencies necessary. It also depicts the many career paths available, including vertical and lateral advancement opportunities.[275]

The following terms used with regards to computer security are explained below:

THE PROLOGUE


 Enter Chorus.

CHORUS.
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

 [_Exit._]




ACT I

SCENE I. A public place.


 Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.

SAMPSON.
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

GREGORY.
No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON.
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.

GREGORY.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.

SAMPSON.
I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.

SAMPSON.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.

GREGORY.
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.

SAMPSON.
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.

GREGORY.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON.
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the
men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.

GREGORY.
The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.

GREGORY.
They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a
pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY.
’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.
Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.

 Enter Abram and Balthasar.

SAMPSON.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY.
How? Turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON.
Fear me not.

GREGORY.
No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

SAMPSON.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it.

ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON.
I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON.
Is the law of our side if I say ay?

GREGORY.
No.

SAMPSON.
No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY.
Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAM.
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

SAMPSON.
But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAM.
No better.

SAMPSON.
Well, sir.

 Enter Benvolio.

GREGORY.
Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

SAMPSON.
Yes, better, sir.

ABRAM.
You lie.

SAMPSON.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.

 [_They fight._]

BENVOLIO.
Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.

 [_Beats down their swords._]

 Enter Tybalt.

TYBALT.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO.
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward.

 [_They fight._]

 Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.

FIRST CITIZEN.
Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

 Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.

CAPULET.
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET.
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?

CAPULET.
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

 Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.

MONTAGUE.
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

 Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.

PRINCE.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona’s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

 [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
 Citizens and Servants._]

MONTAGUE.
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO.
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them, in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE.
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO.
Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO.
Have you importun’d him by any means?

MONTAGUE.
Both by myself and many other friends;
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.

 Enter Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
See, where he comes. So please you step aside;
I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.

MONTAGUE.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,

 [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]

BENVOLIO.
Good morrow, cousin.

ROMEO.
Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO.
But new struck nine.

ROMEO.
Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?

ROMEO.
Not having that which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO.
In love?

ROMEO.
Out.

BENVOLIO.
Of love?

ROMEO.
Out of her favour where I am in love.

BENVOLIO.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.

ROMEO.
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO.
No coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO.
Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO.
At thy good heart’s oppression.

ROMEO.
Why such is love’s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

 [_Going._]

BENVOLIO.
Soft! I will go along:
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.

BENVOLIO.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?

ROMEO.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO.
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.

ROMEO.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.

ROMEO.
A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.

BENVOLIO.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO.
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty starv’d with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO.
Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO.
O teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

ROMEO.
’Tis the way
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO.
I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A Street.

 Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.

CAPULET.
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS.
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET.
But saying o’er what I have said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET.
And too soon marr’d are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
And she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love, and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparell’d April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

 [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]

SERVANT.
Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to
find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what
names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good
time!

 Enter Benvolio and Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO.
For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO.
For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO.
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO.
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.

SERVANT.
God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO.
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

SERVANT.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?

ROMEO.
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.

SERVANT.
Ye say honestly, rest you merry!

ROMEO.
Stay, fellow; I can read.

 [_He reads the letter._]

_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
The lady widow of Utruvio;
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;
Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
Lucio and the lively Helena. _


A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?

SERVANT.
Up.

ROMEO.
Whither to supper?

SERVANT.
To our house.

ROMEO.
Whose house?

SERVANT.
My master’s.

ROMEO.
Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.

SERVANT.
Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,
and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
cup of wine. Rest you merry.

 [_Exit._]

BENVOLIO.
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go thither and with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO.
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
And these who, often drown’d, could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO.
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
Your lady’s love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.

LADY CAPULET.
Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.

NURSE.
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!
God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!

 Enter Juliet.

JULIET.
How now, who calls?

NURSE.
Your mother.

JULIET.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

LADY CAPULET.
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.

NURSE.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET.
She’s not fourteen.

NURSE.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET.
A fortnight and odd days.

NURSE.
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before she broke her brow,
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
A was a merry man,—took up the child:
‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
To see now how a jest shall come about.
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’

LADY CAPULET.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.

NURSE.
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.

JULIET.
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.

NURSE.
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET.
Marry, that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET.
It is an honour that I dream not of.

NURSE.
An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET.
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers. By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

NURSE.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.

NURSE.
Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.

LADY CAPULET.
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide.
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

NURSE.
No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?

JULIET.
I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

 Enter a Servant.

SERVANT.
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady
asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.

LADY CAPULET.
We follow thee.

 [_Exit Servant._]

Juliet, the County stays.

NURSE.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Street.

 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
 Torch-bearers and others.

ROMEO.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?

BENVOLIO.
The date is out of such prolixity:
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will,
We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO.
Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO.
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO.
You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO.
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]
A visor for a visor. What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO.
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO.
A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.

ROMEO.
Nay, that’s not so.

MERCUTIO.
I mean sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But ’tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO.
Why, may one ask?

ROMEO.
I dreamt a dream tonight.

MERCUTIO.
And so did I.

ROMEO.
Well what was yours?

MERCUTIO.
That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she,—

ROMEO.
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Thou talk’st of nothing.

MERCUTIO.
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO.
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO.
I fear too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night’s revels; and expire the term
Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!

BENVOLIO.
Strike, drum.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.

FIRST SERVANT.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!

SECOND SERVANT.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.

FIRST SERVANT.
Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!

SECOND SERVANT.
Ay, boy, ready.

FIRST SERVANT.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the
great chamber.

SECOND SERVANT.
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and
the longer liver take all.

 [_Exeunt._]

 Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.

CAPULET.
Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes
Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah my mistresses, which of you all
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor, and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls.

 [_Music plays, and they dance._]

More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is’t now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

CAPULET’S COUSIN.
By’r Lady, thirty years.

CAPULET.
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.

CAPULET’S COUSIN.
’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

CAPULET.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO.
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?

SERVANT.
I know not, sir.

ROMEO.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT.
This by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET.
Why how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET.
Young Romeo, is it?

TYBALT.
’Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET.
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
A bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT.
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
I’ll not endure him.

CAPULET.
He shall be endur’d.
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
Am I the master here, or you? Go to.
You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!

TYBALT.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

CAPULET.
Go to, go to!
You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.

TYBALT.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.

ROMEO.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.

ROMEO.
Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
[_Kissing her._]

JULIET.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!
Give me my sin again.

JULIET.
You kiss by the book.

NURSE.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO.
What is her mother?

NURSE.
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO.
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.

BENVOLIO.
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
I’ll to my rest.

 [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]

JULIET.
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?

NURSE.
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET.
What’s he that now is going out of door?

NURSE.
Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.

JULIET.
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?

NURSE.
I know not.

JULIET.
Go ask his name. If he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

NURSE.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

NURSE.
What’s this? What’s this?

JULIET.
A rhyme I learn’d even now
Of one I danc’d withal.

 [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]

NURSE.
Anon, anon!
Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.

 [_Exeunt._]




ACT II


 Enter Chorus.

CHORUS.
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.

 Enter Romeo.

ROMEO.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

 [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]

 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.

BENVOLIO.
Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!

MERCUTIO.
He is wise,
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO.
He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO.
Nay, I’ll conjure too.
Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.

BENVOLIO.
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO.
This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
That were some spite. My invocation
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO.
Go then; for ’tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.

 Enter Romeo.

ROMEO.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

 Juliet appears above at a window.

But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.

JULIET.
Ay me.

ROMEO.
She speaks.
O speak again bright angel, for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO.
[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

JULIET.
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.

ROMEO.
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET.
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO.
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

ROMEO.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

JULIET.
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO.
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

JULIET.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO.
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?

ROMEO.
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
I should adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET.
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—

JULIET.
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO.
What shall I swear by?

JULIET.
Do not swear at all.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I’ll believe thee.

ROMEO.
If my heart’s dear love,—

JULIET.
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.

ROMEO.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET.
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

ROMEO.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.

JULIET.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO.
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

JULIET.
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
[_Nurse calls within._]
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.

 Enter Juliet above.

JULIET.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.

JULIET.
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee,—

NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.

JULIET.
By and by I come—
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send.

ROMEO.
So thrive my soul,—

JULIET.
A thousand times good night.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.

 [_Retiring slowly._]

 Re-enter Juliet, above.

JULIET.
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.

ROMEO.
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears.

JULIET.
Romeo.

ROMEO.
My nyas?

JULIET.
What o’clock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO.
By the hour of nine.

JULIET.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET.
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO.
I would I were thy bird.

JULIET.
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find.
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.

 Enter Romeo.

Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

ROMEO.
Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper’d head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

ROMEO.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?

ROMEO.
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.

ROMEO.
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO.
And bad’st me bury love.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.

ROMEO.
I pray thee chide me not, her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come young waverer, come go with me,
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.

ROMEO.
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Street.

 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.

MERCUTIO.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?

BENVOLIO.
Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO.
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.

MERCUTIO.
A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO.
Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO.
Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt?

BENVOLIO.
Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO.
More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of
compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.

BENVOLIO.
The what?

MERCUTIO.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good
whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!

 Enter Romeo.

BENVOLIO.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

MERCUTIO.
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to
his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to
berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings
and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

ROMEO.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO.
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams.

ROMEO.
Meaning, to curtsy.

MERCUTIO.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO.
A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO.
Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO.
Right.

ROMEO.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO.
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
wearing, solely singular.

ROMEO.
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!

MERCUTIO.
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO.
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.

MERCUTIO.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO.
Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
goose.

MERCUTIO.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO.
Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.

ROMEO.
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO.
O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad.

ROMEO.
I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO.
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as
well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO.
Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO.
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer.

 Enter Nurse and Peter.

ROMEO.
Here’s goodly gear!
A sail, a sail!

MERCUTIO.
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

NURSE.
Peter!

PETER.
Anon.

NURSE.
My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO.
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.

NURSE.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO.
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

NURSE.
Is it good-den?

MERCUTIO.
’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.

NURSE.
Out upon you! What a man are you?

ROMEO.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.

NURSE.
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO.
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.

NURSE.
You say well.

MERCUTIO.
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.

NURSE.
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

BENVOLIO.
She will endite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

ROMEO.
What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO.
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[_Sings._]
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
  Is very good meat in Lent;
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score
  When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.

ROMEO.
I will follow you.

MERCUTIO.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.

 [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]

NURSE.
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?

ROMEO.
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

NURSE.
And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those
that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
use me at his pleasure!

PETER.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another
man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.

NURSE.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy
knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me
enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first
let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with
her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
very weak dealing.

ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
thee,—

NURSE.
Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will
be a joyful woman.

ROMEO.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.

NURSE.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO.
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.

NURSE.
No truly, sir; not a penny.

ROMEO.
Go to; I say you shall.

NURSE.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.

ROMEO.
And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

NURSE.
Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.

ROMEO.
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?

NURSE.
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO.
I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.

NURSE.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO.
Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.

NURSE.
Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.

ROMEO.
Commend me to thy lady.

NURSE.
Ay, a thousand times. Peter!

 [_Exit Romeo._]

PETER.
Anon.

NURSE.
Before and apace.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.

 Enter Juliet.

JULIET.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me.
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

 Enter Nurse and Peter.

O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

NURSE.
Peter, stay at the gate.

 [_Exit Peter._]

JULIET.
Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

NURSE.
I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!

JULIET.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.

NURSE.
Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
out of breath?

JULIET.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?

NURSE.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the
flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that?

NURSE.
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.

JULIET.
I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?

NURSE.
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?

JULIET.
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘Where is your mother?’

NURSE.
O God’s lady dear,
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET.
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?

NURSE.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?

JULIET.
I have.

NURSE.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church. I must another way,
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

JULIET.
Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.

ROMEO.
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

 Enter Juliet.

Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO.
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET.
Conceit more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

 [_Exeunt._]




ACT III

SCENE I. A public Place.


 Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.

BENVOLIO.
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO.
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no
need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO.
Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO.
And what to?

MERCUTIO.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO.
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO.
The fee simple! O simple!

 Enter Tybalt and others.

BENVOLIO.
By my head, here comes the Capulets.

MERCUTIO.
By my heel, I care not.

TYBALT.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO.
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
word and a blow.

TYBALT.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
occasion.

MERCUTIO.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT.
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

MERCUTIO.
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of
us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO.
Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.

 Enter Romeo.

TYBALT.
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.

MERCUTIO.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him man.

TYBALT.
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: Thou art a villain.

ROMEO.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.

TYBALT.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO.
I do protest I never injur’d thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
And so good Capulet, which name I tender
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

MERCUTIO.
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT.
What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO.
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

TYBALT.
[_Drawing._] I am for you.

ROMEO.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO.
Come, sir, your passado.

 [_They fight._]

ROMEO.
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

 [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]

MERCUTIO.
I am hurt.
A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO.
What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.
Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.

 [_Exit Page._]

ROMEO.
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both
your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
arm.

ROMEO.
I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO.
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
They have made worms’ meat of me.
I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!

 [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]

ROMEO.
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.

 Re-enter Benvolio.

BENVOLIO.
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,
That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO.
This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end.

 Re-enter Tybalt.

BENVOLIO.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO.
Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO.
This shall determine that.

 [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]

BENVOLIO.
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO.
O, I am fortune’s fool!

BENVOLIO.
Why dost thou stay?

 [_Exit Romeo._]

 Enter Citizens.

FIRST CITIZEN.
Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO.
There lies that Tybalt.

FIRST CITIZEN.
Up, sir, go with me.
I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.

 Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.

PRINCE.
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO.
O noble Prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET.
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin.

PRINCE.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
Your high displeasure. All this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET.
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE.
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE.
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enter Juliet.

JULIET.
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.

 Enter Nurse, with cords.

Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?

NURSE.
Ay, ay, the cords.

 [_Throws them down._]

JULIET.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?

NURSE.
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.

JULIET.
Can heaven be so envious?

NURSE.
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET.
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

NURSE.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.

JULIET.
O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.

NURSE.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead.

JULIET.
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
For who is living, if those two are gone?

NURSE.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.

JULIET.
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?

NURSE.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.

JULIET.
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace.

NURSE.
There’s no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo.

JULIET.
Blister’d be thy tongue
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

NURSE.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?

JULIET.
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?

NURSE.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET.
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.

NURSE.
Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.

JULIET.
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.

 Enter Friar Lawrence.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity.

 Enter Romeo.

ROMEO.
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.

ROMEO.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.

ROMEO.
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say banishment.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO.
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
And world’s exile is death. Then banished
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.

ROMEO.
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
They are free men but I am banished.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
But banished to kill me? Banished?
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
To mangle me with that word banished?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,

ROMEO.
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, then I see that mad men have no ears.

ROMEO.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

 [_Knocking within._]

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.

 [_Knocking._]

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.

 [_Knocking._]

Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.

 [_Knocking._]

Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?

NURSE.
[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
I come from Lady Juliet.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Welcome then.

 Enter Nurse.

NURSE.
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

NURSE.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO.
Nurse.

NURSE.
Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.

ROMEO.
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?

NURSE.
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

ROMEO.
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

 [_Drawing his sword._]

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold thy desperate hand.
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.

NURSE.
O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

NURSE.
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

 [_Exit._]

ROMEO.
How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here.
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.

ROMEO.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
Farewell.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.

 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.

CAPULET.
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been abed an hour ago.

PARIS.
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET.
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.

CAPULET.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
But, soft, what day is this?

PARIS.
Monday, my lord.

CAPULET.
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

CAPULET.
Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me, it is so very very late that we
May call it early by and by. Good night.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.

 Enter Romeo and Juliet.

JULIET.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.

ROMEO.
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.

JULIET.
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
O now be gone, more light and light it grows.

ROMEO.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

 Enter Nurse.

NURSE.
Madam.

JULIET.
Nurse?

NURSE.
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
The day is broke, be wary, look about.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO.
Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.

 [_Descends._]

JULIET.
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo.

ROMEO.
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET.
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO.
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET.
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.

ROMEO.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.

 [_Exit below._]

JULIET.
O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back.

LADY CAPULET.
[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?

JULIET.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?

 Enter Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
Why, how now, Juliet?

JULIET.
Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET.
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

JULIET.
Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.

JULIET.
What villain, madam?

LADY CAPULET.
That same villain Romeo.

JULIET.
Villain and he be many miles asunder.
God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

LADY CAPULET.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET.
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.

LADY CAPULET.
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET.
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.

LADY CAPULET.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.

JULIET.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET.
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.

LADY CAPULET.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.

 Enter Capulet and Nurse.

CAPULET.
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET.
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave.

CAPULET.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET.
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

CAPULET.
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET.
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?

JULIET.
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET.
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding.

NURSE.
God in heaven bless her.
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET.
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

NURSE.
I speak no treason.

CAPULET.
O God ye good-en!

NURSE.
May not one speak?

CAPULET.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET.
You are too hot.

CAPULET.
God’s bread, it makes me mad!
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match’d, and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself.
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, Nurse.

NURSE.
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the County.
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET.
Speakest thou from thy heart?

NURSE.
And from my soul too,
Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET.
Amen.

NURSE.
What?

JULIET.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
To make confession and to be absolv’d.

NURSE.
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

 [_Exit._]




ACT IV

SCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.


 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

PARIS.
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Uneven is the course; I like it not.

PARIS.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

 Enter Juliet.

PARIS.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS.
That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET.
What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s a certain text.

PARIS.
Come you to make confession to this father?

JULIET.
To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS.
Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET.
I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.

PARIS.
Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.

JULIET.
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS.
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.

JULIET.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.

JULIET.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS.
God shield I should disturb devotion!—
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

 [_Exit._]

JULIET.
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this County.

JULIET.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
Give me some present counsel, or behold
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.

JULIET.
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Each part depriv’d of supple government,
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
Then as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come, and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET.
Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.

CAPULET.
So many guests invite as here are writ.

 [_Exit first Servant._]

Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

SECOND SERVANT.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their
fingers.

CAPULET.
How canst thou try them so?

SECOND SERVANT.
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET.
Go, begone.

 [_Exit second Servant._]

We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?

NURSE.
Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.

 Enter Juliet.

NURSE.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

CAPULET.
How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?

JULIET.
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.

CAPULET.
Send for the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.

JULIET.
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET.
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

LADY CAPULET.
No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.

CAPULET.
Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.

 [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]

LADY CAPULET.
We shall be short in our provision,
’Tis now near night.

CAPULET.
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber.

 Enter Juliet and Nurse.

JULIET.
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.

 Enter Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?

JULIET.
No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET.
Good night.
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.

 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]

JULIET.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!—What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.

 [_Laying down her dagger._]

What if it be a poison, which the Friar
Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears,
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.

 [_Throws herself on the bed._]

SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.

 Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.

LADY CAPULET.
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.

NURSE.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

 Enter Capulet.

CAPULET.
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,
The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;
Spare not for cost.

NURSE.
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
For this night’s watching.

CAPULET.
No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.

LADY CAPULET.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]

CAPULET.
A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!

 Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.

Now, fellow, what’s there?

FIRST SERVANT.
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET.
Make haste, make haste.

 [_Exit First Servant._]

—Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

SECOND SERVANT.
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

 [_Exit._]

CAPULET.
Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
The County will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would. I hear him near.

 [_Play music._]

Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!

 Re-enter Nurse.

Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.
Make haste I say.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.

 Enter Nurse.

NURSE.
Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
O, well-a-day that ever I was born.
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!

 Enter Lady Capulet.

LADY CAPULET.
What noise is here?

NURSE.
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET.
What is the matter?

NURSE.
Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET.
O me, O me! My child, my only life.
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
Help, help! Call help.

 Enter Capulet.

CAPULET.
For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.

NURSE.
She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET.
Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!

CAPULET.
Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

NURSE.
O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET.
O woful time!

CAPULET.
Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET.
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son, the night before thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.

PARIS.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET.
Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.

NURSE.
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
Most lamentable day, most woeful day
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.
Never was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day, O woeful day.

PARIS.
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!

CAPULET.
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid.
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion,
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
She’s not well married that lives married long,
But she’s best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
And in her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.

CAPULET.
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

 [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

NURSE.
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
For well you know this is a pitiful case.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

 [_Exit Nurse._]

 Enter Peter.

PETER.
Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you
will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Why ‘Heart’s ease’?

PETER.
O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play
me some merry dump to comfort me.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.

PETER.
You will not then?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
No.

PETER.
I will then give it you soundly.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?

PETER.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Then will I give you the serving-creature.

PETER.
Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will
carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
And you re us and fa us, you note us.

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER.
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound’—
Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
Simon Catling?

FIRST MUSICIAN.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

SECOND MUSICIAN.
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.

PETER.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?

THIRD MUSICIAN.
Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER.
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is
‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for
sounding.
      ‘Then music with her silver sound
      With speedy help doth lend redress.’

 [_Exit._]

FIRST MUSICIAN.
What a pestilent knave is this same!

SECOND MUSICIAN.
Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay
dinner.

 [_Exeunt._]




ACT V

SCENE I. Mantua. A Street.


 Enter Romeo.

ROMEO.
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.

 Enter Balthasar.

News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
For nothing can be ill if she be well.

BALTHASAR.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
And presently took post to tell it you.
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO.
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.

BALTHASAR.
I do beseech you sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

ROMEO.
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?

BALTHASAR.
No, my good lord.

ROMEO.
No matter. Get thee gone,
And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.

 [_Exit Balthasar._]

Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
I do remember an apothecary,—
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said,
And if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
What, ho! Apothecary!

 Enter Apothecary.

APOTHECARY.
Who calls so loud?

ROMEO.
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins,
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
As violently as hasty powder fir’d
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

APOTHECARY.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.

APOTHECARY.
My poverty, but not my will consents.

ROMEO.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

APOTHECARY.
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.

ROMEO.
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
Doing more murder in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

 [_Exeunt._]

SCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.

 Enter Friar John.

FRIAR JOHN.
Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!

 Enter Friar Lawrence.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN.
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN.
I could not send it,—here it is again,—
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.

 [_Exit._]

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.

 [_Exit._]

SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.

 Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.

PARIS.
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE.
[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.

 [_Retires._]

PARIS.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

 [_The Page whistles._]

The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.

 [_Retires._]

 Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.

ROMEO.
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO.
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR.
For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

 [_Retires_]

ROMEO.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

 [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]

And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.

PARIS.
This is that banish’d haughty Montague
That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died,—
And here is come to do some villainous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.

 [_Advances._]

Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.
Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.

ROMEO.
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury. O be gone.
By heaven I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm’d against myself.
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.

PARIS.
I do defy thy conjuration,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO.
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!

 [_They fight._]

PAGE.
O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

 [_Exit._]

PARIS.
O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

 [_Dies._]

ROMEO.
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.

 [_Laying Paris in the monument._]

How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! Which their keepers call
A lightning before death. O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

 [_Dies._]

 Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a
 lantern, crow, and spade.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?

BALTHASAR.
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It burneth in the Capels’ monument.

BALTHASAR.
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
One that you love.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who is it?

BALTHASAR.
Romeo.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR.
Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR.
I dare not, sir;
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR.
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo! [_Advances._]
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?

 [_Enters the monument._]

Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
The lady stirs.

 [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]

JULIET.
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

 [_Noise within._]

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

JULIET.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

 [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]

What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.

 [_Kisses him._]

Thy lips are warm!

FIRST WATCH.
[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?

JULIET.
Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.

 [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]

This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.

 [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]

 Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.

PAGE.
This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.

FIRST WATCH.
The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.

 [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]

Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
Raise up the Montagues, some others search.

 [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]

We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

 Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.

SECOND WATCH.
Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.

FIRST WATCH.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

 Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.

THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

FIRST WATCH.
A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.

 Enter the Prince and Attendants.

PRINCE.
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning’s rest?

 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.

CAPULET.
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET.
O the people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE.
What fear is this which startles in our ears?

FIRST WATCH.
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill’d.

PRINCE.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

FIRST WATCH.
Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men’s tombs.

CAPULET.
O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.

LADY CAPULET.
O me! This sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

 Enter Montague and others.

PRINCE.
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE.
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE.
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE.
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.

PRINCE.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?

BALTHASAR.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not, and left him there.

PRINCE.
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE.
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE.
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.

CAPULET.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE.
But I can give thee more,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET.
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.

PRINCE.
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

 [_Exeunt._]

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

                                PREFACE.

                                -------


THIS book consists of two parts: a History and a Guide.

The “History” attempts (after the fashion of a pageant) to marshal the
activities of Alexandria during the two thousand two hundred and fifty
years of her existence. Starting with the heroic figure of Alexander the
Great, it inspects the dynasty of the Ptolemies, and in particular the
career of the last of them, Cleopatra; an account of Ptolemaic
literature and science follows, and closes this splendid period, to
which I have given the title of “Greco-Egyptian.” The second period,
called “Christian”, begins with the rule of Rome, and traces the
fortunes of Christianity, first as a persecuted and then as a
persecuting power: all is lost in 641, when the Patriarch Cyrus betrays
Alexandria to the Arabs. An interlude comes next—“The Spiritual
City”—which meditates upon Alexandrian philosophy and religion, both
Pagan and Christian: it seemed better to segregate these subjects,
partly because they interrupt the main historical procession, partly
because many readers are not interested in them. History is resumed in
the “Arab Period,” which is of no importance though it lasts over 1,000
years—from Amr to Napoleon. With Napoleon begins the “Modern Period,”
the main feature of which is the building of the city we now see under
the auspices of Mohammed Ali; and the pageant concludes, as well as it
may, with an account of the events of 1882, and with surmises as to
future municipal developments.

The “History” is written in short sections, and at the end of each
section are references to the second part—the “Guide”. _On these
references the chief utility of the book depends_, so the reader is
begged to take special note of them: they may help him to link the
present and the past. Suppose, for instance, he has read in the History
about the Pharos: at the end of the section he will find references to
Fort Kait Bey where the Pharos stood, to Abousir where there is a
miniature replica of it, and to the Coin Room in the Museum, where it
appears on the moneys of Domitian and Hadrian. Or again, suppose that
the tragic fate of Hypatia has touched him: at the end will be
references to the Caesareum, where Hypatia was murdered, and to the Wady
Natrun, where the monks who murdered her generally resided. Or the
British victories of 1801: he will be referred to the country over which
our troops marched, to the Abercrombie Monument at Sidi Gaber, and to a
tombstone in the courtyard of the Greek Patriarchate. The “sights” of
Alexandria are in themselves not interesting, but they fascinate when we
approach them through the past, and this is what I have tried to do by
the double arrangement of History and Guide.

The “Guide” calls for no introduction. It is written from the practical
standpoint, and is intended to be used on the spot. Maps and plans
accompany it. The city is divided into sections, the visitor in every
case starting from the Square. Other sections deal with the environs,
and with the surrounding country as far as Rosetta on the east and
Abousir on the west. In transliterating Arabic names I have preferred
the French system: there are three English systems, each backed by a
rival government department, so the French seems the safer course, and
if I have not kept to it rigidly, I am only following, though at a
respectful distance, the example of the Alexandria Municipality. Here
and there some History has crept into the Guide—notably in the case of
Aboukir, whose fortunes, though dependent on Alexandria’s, present
features of their own.

                              AUTHORITIES.

                                -------


There is, so far as I know, no monograph on Alexandria, and though the
present little book makes no claim to original research, it has drawn
together much information that was hitherto scattered. The following
works, among others, have been consulted; those marked with an asterisk
are published locally.

(A). HISTORY:—

Ptolemaic Period:—_Bouché-Leclercq, Histoire des Lagides_. A scholarly
and delightful work. 4 vols.

Ptolemaic Literature:—_A. Couat, La Poésie Alexandrine_; well written.
_Theocritus_, translated A. Lang.

Christian Period:—No satisfactory work. _S. Sharpe, History of Egypt
until the Arab Conquest, vol. 2_ may be consulted; also _Gibbon_, chs.
21 and 47. _Mrs. Butcher, The Story of the Church in Egypt_ is full of
information, but uncritical and diffuse.

Arab Conquest:—_A. J. Butler, The Arab Conquest of Egypt_. A monograph
of the highest merit, brilliantly written and practically reconstructing
the episode.

Jewish Thought:—_E. Herriot, Philon le Juif._

Neo-Platonism:—Various works. There is a lucid introduction to Plotinus
in _S. McKenna, Translation of the Enneads_, vol. 1; this admirable
translation is still in progress. _Porphyry’s Letter to Marcella_
(translated, A. Gardner) is also interesting.

Christian Theology:—See under “Christian period.” The Fathers can be
read in the _Ante-Nicene Christian Library_.

Arab period:—Too obscure to possess a history.

Napoleonic Wars:—_Mahan, Influence of Sea Power upon the French
Revolution_, chs. 9 and 10. _R. T_. _Wilson, History of the British
Expedition to Egypt_. See also below, under Aboukir.

General Modern History:—_D. A. Cameron, Egypt in the Nineteenth
Century_. A well-written book by the late Consul General at Alexandria;
contains good account of Mohammed Ali. The works of Lord Cromer, W. S.
Blunt and Sir V. Chirol are also useful.

Events of 1882:—_C. Royle, The Egyptian Campaigns_.

One or two novels and plays dealing with the History may here be
mentioned. The career of Cleopatra has inspired two noble tragedies,
Shakespeare’s _Antony and Cleopatra_, and Dryden’s _All for Love_;
extracts from them are given on p. 214. Dryden’s masterpiece should be
better known; it is most moving, admirably constructed, and contains
some magnificent scenes. A novel by Pierre Loüys, _Aphrodite_, also
treats of the period, but in a scented Parisian way.—Anatole France,
_Thais_, pictures life in the 4th cent. A.D.; the details are both vivid
and accurate, and build up a perfect work of art.—For the early 5th
cent. there is Charles Kingsley’s _Hypatia_, a rousing yarn about the
final contest between Paganism and Christianity; Kingsley is always
readable, but his bluff burly mind was incapable of understanding
Alexandria.—Two good novels by Marmaduke Pickthall, _Said the Fisherman_
and _Children of the Nile_ touch upon events in the modern period.

                  *       *       *       *       *

(B). GUIDE.:—

*_E. Breccia, Alexandrea ad Aegyptum._ In French: English translation
announced. Deals mainly with Classical Antiquities. Two sections—the
first dealing with the remains in the city and environs, the second with
the Greco-Roman Museum, of which Professor Breccia is the distinguished
Curator. I am under much obligation to this fine scholarly book,
especially in the following sections:—Greco-Roman Museum, Catacombs of
Anfouchi and Kom es Chogafa, Serapeum, Abousir.

Prehistoric Harbour:—*_E. Jondet, Les Ports submergés de l’ancienne Isle
de Pharos_. A monograph by the discoverer. Magnificent Maps.

Pharos and Fort Kait Bey:—_H. Thiersch, Pharos, Antike, Islam Und
Occident_. A standard monograph, but exhibiting the defects as well as
the merits of German Scholarship.

Canopus and Aboukir:—*_J. Faivre, Canopus, Menouthis, Aboukir_.
Published in French and English. *_R. D. Downes, A History of Canopus._
These excellent pamphlets supplement one another, the first dealing with
the literary evidence, the second with the typography.

Rosetta:—*_Max Herz Bey, Les Mosquées de Rosette_ (various articles in
the _Comptes Rendus_ of the Comité de Conservation des Monuments
Arabes).

St. Menas:—*_C. M. Kaufmann, La Decouverte des Sanctuaires de Menas_. By
the Excavator.

Natrun Monasteries:—_A. J. Butler, Ancient Coptic Churches_.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Many friends have also helped me, among whom I would particularly thank
the following:—Mr. George Antonius for his assistance with those
interesting but little known buildings, the Alexandria Mosques; Mr. M.
S. Briggs for his help in the Rosetta section; Dr. A. J. Butler for
permission to reproduce two plans of the Natrun Churches; Mr. C. P.
Cavafy for permission to publish one of his poems, and Mr. G.
Valassopoulo for translating the same; the Rev. R. D. Downes for his
help at Aboukir; Mr. R. A. Furness for his verse translations from
Callimachus and other Greek poets; M. E. Jondet, Director of Ports and
Lights, for taking me to see his fascinating discovery, the Prehistoric
Harbour, and for placing at my disposal his unrivalled collection of
Maps and Views, two of which I have reproduced; and above all Mr. G. H.
Ludolf, to whose suggestion this book is due, and without whose help it
would never have been completed. I shall never forget the kindness that
I have received at Alexandria, and in no wise endorse the verdict of my
predecessor the poet Gelal ed Din ben Mokram who monstrously asserts
that:—

    The visitor to Alexandria receives nothing in the way of hospitality
    Except some water and an account of Pompey’s Pillar.
    Those who wish to treat him very well go so far as to offer some
       fresh air
    And to tell him where the Lighthouse is.
    They also instruct him about the sea and its waves,
    Adding a description of the large Greek boats.
    The visitor need not aspire to receive any bread,
    For to a request of this sort there is no reply.


Circumstances which I could not control have delayed the publication of
the book, but, with the help of friends, I have tried to bring the
“Guide” up to date as far as possible.

                        THE LAND AND THE WATERS.


The situation of Alexandria is most curious. To understand it we must go
back many thousand years.

Ages ago, before there was civilization in Egypt, or the delta of the
Nile had been formed, the whole of the country as far south as Cairo lay
under the sea. The shores of this sea were a limestone desert. The
coastline was smooth as a rule, but at the north-west corner an
extraordinary spur jutted out from the main mass. It was not more than a
mile wide, but many miles long. Its base is not far from the modern
Bahig. Alexandria is built half-way down it, and its tip is the headland
of Aboukir. On each side of it there used to be deep salt water.

Centuries passed, and the Nile, issuing out of his crack above Cairo,
kept carrying down the muds of Upper Egypt, and dropping them as soon as
his current slackened. In the north-west corner they were arrested by
this spur, and began to silt up against it. It was a shelter not only
from the outer sea, but from the prevalent wind. Alluvial land appeared;
the huge shallow lake of Mariout was formed; and the current of the
Nile, unable to escape through the limestone barrier, rounded the
headland of Aboukir, and entered the outer sea by what was known in
historical times as the “Canopic” Mouth.

This explains one characteristic of Alexandrian scenery—the long narrow
ridge edged on the north by the sea and on the south by a lake and flat
fields. But it does not explain why Alexandria has a harbour.

To the north of the spur, and more or less parallel to it, runs a second
limestone range. It is much shorter than the spur and much lower, being
often below the surface of the sea in the form of reefs. It seems
unimportant. But without it there would have been no harbour (and
consequently no town), because it breaks the force of the waves.
Starting at Agame it continues as a series of rocks across the entrance
of the modern harbour. Then it reemerges to form the hammer-headed
promontory of Ras-el-Tin, disappears into a second series of rocks that
close the entrance of the Eastern Harbour, and makes its final
appearance at the promontory of Silsileh, after which it rejoins the big
spur.

Such are the main features of the situation; a limestone ridge, with
harbours on one side of it, and alluvial country on the other. It is a
situation unique in Egypt, and the Alexandrians have never been truly
Egyptian.

                       PHAROS, RHAKOTIS, CANOPUS.


Who first settled on this remarkable stretch of coast? There seem to
have been three early centres.

(i). Homer (Odyssey, Book iv) says:—

    “There is an island in the surging sea, which they call Pharos,
    lying off Egypt. It has a harbour with good anchorage, and hence
    they put out to sea after drawing water.”

Homer’s island is now the promontory of Ras-el-Tin; the intervening
channel has silted up. There are no traces of any early settlement on
its soil, but in the sea to its north and west the masonry of a
prehistoric harbour has been found. Homer goes on to tell how Menelaus
was becalmed on Pharos as he returned from Troy, and how he could not
get away until he had entrapped Proteus, the divine king of the island,
and exacted a favourable wind. A similar legend has been found in an
ancient Egyptian papyrus. There the King is called the “Prouti” or
“Pharaoh”. “Prouti” is probably the original of Homer’s “Proteus,”
“Pharaoh” of his “Pharos.” It is significant that our first glimpse of
the coast should be through the eyes of a Greek sailor.

(ii). But our historical survey must begin with Rhakotis. Rhakotis was a
small Egyptian town built on the rise where “Pompey’s Pillar” stands
now, and it existed as long ago as 1,300 B.C., for statues of that time
have been found here. The people were coast guards and goat herds. Their
chief god was Osiris. Rhakotis was never important in itself. But it is
important as an element in the great Greek city that was built up round
it. It was a little lump of Egypt. Compare it to the Arab villages and
slums that have been embedded in the scheme of the modern town—to
Mazarita or to Kom-el-Dik. Rhakotis was like one of these. The native
and conservative element naturally rallied to it, and it became the site
for Alexandria’s great religious effort—the cult of Serapis.

(iii). At the tip of the limestone ridge, where the Nile once entered
the sea, was another early settlement. It also appears in Greek legend.
In historical times, it was known as Canopus.

                    ALEXANDER THE GREAT (B.C. 331).


Few cities have made so magnificent an entry into history as Alexandria.
She was founded by Alexander the Great.

When he arrived here he was only twenty-five years old. His career must
be sketched. He was a Macedonian and had begun by destroying the
city-civilization of ancient Greece. But he did not hate the Greeks, no,
he admired them immensely and desired to be treated as if he was one,
and his next exploit was to lead a crusade against Greece’s traditional
enemy, Persia, and to defeat her in two tremendous battles, one at the
Dardanelles and one in Asia Minor. As soon as he conquered Syria, Egypt
fell into his hands, and fell willingly, for she too hated the Persians.
He went to Memphis (near modern Cairo). Then he descended the Nile to
the coast, and ordered his architect Dinocrates to build round the
nucleus of Rhakotis a magnificent Greek city. This was not mere idealism
on his part, or rather idealism was happily combined with utility. He
needed a capital for his new Egyptian kingdom, and to link it with
Macedonia that capital had to be on the coast. Here was the very place—a
splendid harbour, a perfect climate, fresh water, limestone quarries,
and easy access to the Nile. Here he would perpetuate all that was best
in Hellenism, and would create a metropolis for that greater Greece that
should consist not of city-states but of kingdoms, and should include
the whole inhabited world.

Alexandria was founded.

Having given his orders, the young man hurried on. He never saw a single
building rise. His next care was a visit to the temple of Ammon in the
Siwan Oasis, where the priest saluted him as a god, and henceforward his
Greek sympathies declined. He became an Oriental, a cosmopolitan almost,
and though he fought Persia again, it was in a new spirit. He wanted to
harmonise the world now, not to Hellenise it, and must have looked back
on Alexandria as a creation of his immaturity. But he was after all to
return to her. Eight years later, having conquered Persia, he died, and
his body, after some vicissitudes, was brought to Memphis for burial.
The High Priest refused to receive it there. “Do not settle him here,”
he cried, “but at the city he has built at Rhakotis, for wherever this
body must lie the city will be uneasy, disturbed with wars and battles.”
So he descended the Nile again, wrapped in gold and enclosed in a coffin
of glass, and he was buried at the centre of Alexandria, by her great
cross roads, to be her civic hero and tutelary god.

                          THE FOUNDATION PLAN.

                   (_See Map of Ancient City p._ 98).


Before dissecting Alexander’s plan we must remember three differences in
the configuration of the soil as it existed in his day.

(i). As already pointed out, Ras-el-Tin was then an island. He thought
of building here, but rejected the site as too cramped. A shrine to his
dead friend Hephaestion rose here, that was all.

(ii). Lake Mariout was much deeper then than now, and directly connected
with the Nile. Consequently it was almost as important a water-way as
the sea, and a lake harbour was an integral part of the plan.

(iii). There was then through water-connection between the Mediterranean
and the Red Sea. The ancient Egyptians had cut a canal from the Nile at
Memphis down to the salt lakes that begin by the modern Ismailia. Thus
Alexandria stood in the position of Port Said to-day; a maritime gateway
to India and the remoter east.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The city was oblong, and filled up the strip between the Lake and the
sea; she was laid out in rigidly straight lines. Her main street (the
“Canopic”) still exists in part as the Rue Rosette. It ran almost due
east and west—a bad direction because it was cut off from the cool north
wind that is the real tutelary god of Alexandria, but, owing to the
site, nothing else could be contrived. Westward it terminated in the
sea; eastward it proceeded to Canopus (Aboukir). It was the natural
highway along the limestone spur, and no doubt existed long before
Alexander came.

Crossing the Canopic Street, and following the line of the present Rue
Nebi Daniel, was the second main artery, the street of the Soma. It
started at the Lake Harbour and ran northward to the sea. Where it
intersected the Canopic Street stood the Soma, or burial place of
Alexander—close to the present Mosque. Parallel to these two streets ran
others, dividing the city into blocks of an American regularity. It
could not have been picturesque, but the Greeks did not desire
picturesqueness. They liked to lay their towns out evenly—Rhodes and
Halicarnassus had just been laid out on the same lines—and the only
natural feature they cared to utilise was the sea. The blocks were
labelled according to the letters of the Greek alphabet.

Of the sea front magnificent use was to be made. Only one feature shall
be mentioned here: the dyke Heptastadion (seven stades long) which was
built to connect the island of Pharos and the mainland. It performed two
functions; it enlarged the city area, and it broke the force of the
currents and created a double harbour—the Great Harbour to the east and
the Eunostos (“Safe Return”) to the west. In the Arab period the
Heptastadion silted up and became the neck of land that leads to
Ras-el-Tin.

The course of the walls is uncertain. Perhaps their eastern course was
from the promontory of Silsileh to the lake, and their western from the
modern Gabbari to the lake. Their foundations were accompanied by a
portent of the usual type. There was not enough chalk to mark the
outlines, so meal had to be substituted, and a number of birds flew out
of the lake and ate it all up. The Greeks interpreted the portent
satisfactorily: to the Egyptians it might well have symbolised the
advent of the hungry foreigner. We are not told what was substituted for
the meal, but somehow or other the walls were built and were studded at
frequent intervals with towers.

When Alexander died the empire was divided among his generals, who ruled
for a little in the name of his half-brother or of his son, but who soon
proclaimed themselves as independent kings. Egypt fell to the ablest and
most discreet of these generals, a Macedonian named Ptolemy. Ptolemy was
no soaring idealist.

Footnote 1:

  Ptolemy IX is omitted from this list; he was probably a dead son of
  Ptolemy VII and Cleopatra II, whom they inserted posthumously in the
  annals as “Neos Philopator.”


He desired neither to Hellenise the world nor to harmonise it. But he
was no cynic either. He respected mental as well as material activity.
He had been present at the foundation of Alexandria, and had evidently
decided that the place would suit him, and now, taking up his abode in
the unfinished city, he began to adorn her with architecture and
scholarship and song. Rival generals, especially in Asia Minor and
Macedonia, occupied much of his energy. At the very beginning of his
rule he was involved in a curious war for the possession of the corpse
of Alexander, which he had kidnapped as it was on its way from Persia to
the Oasis of Ammon. Ptolemy annexed the corpse and much else. Before he
died he had assumed the titles of King and of Soter (saviour), and had
added to his kingdom Cyrene, Palestine, Cyprus, and parts of the Asia
Minor coast. Of this substantial domain Alexandria was the capital, and
also the geographic centre. Then, as now, she belonged not so much to
Egypt as to the Mediterranean, and the Ptolemies realised this. Up in
Egypt they played the Pharaoh, and built solemn archaistic temples like
Edfu and Kom Ombo. Down in Alexandria they were Hellenistic.

The second Ptolemy, Philadelphus, (Friend of his Sister), was a more
pretentious person than his father. He is famous through the praises of
the poets whom he patronised and of the Jews whom he invited, but his
personal achievements were slight. Indeed the chief event of his reign
is domestic rather than military—in 277 he married his sister Arsinoe.
This was as startling to Greek feelings as it is to Christian, but in
Egypt he had a prototype in the god Osiris who had married his sister
Isis, and he justified the union on the highest sacerdotal grounds. He
and Arsinoe were deified as the “Adelphian Gods,” in whose equal veins
flowed the uncontaminated blood of their divine father, the general, and
their example was followed, when possible, by their successors. It was
the pride of race carried to an extreme degree. The royalties of to-day,
for fear of debasing their stock, marry first cousins; the Ptolemies,
more logical, tried to propagate within even narrower limits. In flesh,
as in spirit, the dynasty claimed to be apart from common men, and to
appear as successive emanations of the Deity, in pairs of male and
female. Arsinoe—to come back to earth—was a domineering and sinister
woman. She was seven years older than her brother, and when they married
he had already a wife, whom she drove from Alexandria by her intrigues.
However, he liked her and when, a martyr to indigestion, she died, he
was so far inconsolable that he did not marry again.

The closing years of his reign were divided between his mistresses and
the gout. During a respite from the latter he looked out of his palace
window on some public holiday, and saw beneath him the natives
picnicking on the sand, as they do at the feast of Shem-el-Nessem
to-day. They were obscure, they were happy. “Why can I not be like
them?” sighed the old king, and burst into tears. His reign had been
imposing rather than beautiful and had initiated little in Alexandrian
civilization beyond the somewhat equivocal item of a mystic marriage. He
could endow and patronise. But, unlike Alexander, unlike his father, he
could not create. He completed what they had laid down, and appropriated
the praise.

Ptolemy Euergetes (Well-doer) was the son of Philadelphus by his first
wife. In character he resembled his grandfather. He was a sensible and
successful soldier, with a taste for science. By marrying his cousin
Berenice, he secured Cyrene which had lapsed—Berenice the most highly
praised of all the Ptolemaic Queens, though we know nothing of her
character. In their reign the power of Egypt and the splendour of
Alexandria came to their height. It is now time to examine that
splendour. One hundred years have passed since Alexander laid the
foundations. What has been built upon them?

                          THE PTOLEMAIC CITY.

                   (_See Map of Ancient City p._ 98).


The following were the most important buildings in the Ptolemaic city.

(i). THE LIGHTHOUSE.

The Egyptian coast, being mainly alluvial, is difficult to sight from
the sea. It was therefore imperative to indicate, by some great
monument, where the new city stood. It was desirable too to provide a
guide for sailors through the limestone reefs that line the shore. For
these reasons the Ptolemies built a lighthouse over four hundred feet
high on the Eastern end of Pharos Island (present Fort Kait Bey). Full
details are given later (p. 132); here it is enough to note that the
Pharos (as it was called) was the greatest practical achievement of the
Alexandrian mind and the outward expression of the mathematical studies
carried on in the Mouseion; Sostratus, its architect, was contemporary
with Eratosthenes and Euclid.

A fortress as well as a beacon, the Pharos was the pivot of the city’s
naval defences. It dominated both the harbours, and kept special watch
over the more precious of them—the Eastern, which held the Royal fleet.
Here the promontory of the Palace stretched towards it. Westward, it
could signal over the other harbour to the Chersonese (present Fort
Agame). And further west, the system was prolonged into a long line of
watch towers and beacons that studded the north African coast, and
connected Egypt with her daughter kingdom of Cyrene. One of these towers
(that at Abousir) still remains, and shows in miniature what the Pharos
must once have been.

    TOWER OF ABOUSIR: p. 102

(ii). THE PALACE.

We can locate one point in the Palace, or rather palace-system: it
certainly covered the Promontory of Silsileh, which was then both longer
and broader than now. But no one knows how far the buildings stretched
inland, or along the shore, nor what the architecture was. Each Ptolemy
made additions, and the whole formed a special quarter, somewhat like
the Imperial City at Pekin. Egypt being an autocracy, the palace was the
seat of government as well as royal residence; clerks had their offices
there. There was a palace-harbour (left of Silsileh), and an Island
Palace or Kiosk called Antirrhodus, which rivalled the glories of
Rhodes; Antirrhodus lay in the Eastern Harbour, and rocks, now deep
below the surface of the sea, have been identified with it.

Inland, the Palace connected with another great system—that of the
Mouseion. On its seaward side, it was prolonged by breakwaters towards
the Pharos.

    COLUMNS FROM LOCALITY: Museum, Room 16.

(iii). THE MOUSEION.

The Mouseion at Alexandria was the great intellectual achievement of the
dynasty. Not only did it mould the literature and science of its day,
but it has left a permanent impress upon thought. Its buildings have all
disappeared, and the very site is conjectural; perhaps it had a facade
opposite the Soma, west of the present Rue Nebi Daniel. In its vast
areas were lecture halls, laboratories, observatories, a library, a
dining hall, a park, and a zoo.

It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, who summoned a follower of Aristotle,
Demetrius Phaleras, and ordered him to organise an institution on the
lines of the Athenian Mouseion—a philosophic establishment that had
contained the library of Aristotle. But the Alexandrian Mouseion soon
diverged widely from its model. It was far richer and larger for one
thing; the funds being administered by a priest who was appointed by the
King. And it was essentially a court institution, under palace control,
and knew both the advantages and disadvantages of royal patronage. In
some ways it resembled a modern university, but the scholars and
scientists and literary men whom it supported were under no obligation
to teach; they had only to pursue their studies to the greater glory of
the Ptolemies.

The most famous element in this enormous institution was the
Library—sometimes called the “Mother” library to distinguish it from a
later and even greater collection. 500,000 books, and a catalogue that
occupied 120. The post of “Librarian” was of immense importance and its
holder was the chief official in the Mouseion.

The actual literary and scientific output of the Mouseion will be
considered elsewhere (p. 28).

    RUE NEBI DANIEL (Site of Mouseion?): p. 105

(iv). THE TEMPLE OF SERAPIS.

The idea that one religion is false and another true is essentially
Christian, and had not occurred to the Egyptians and Greeks who were
living together at Alexandria. Each worshipped his own gods, just as he
spoke his own language, but he never thought that the gods of his
neighbour had no existence, and he was willing to believe that they
might be his own gods under another name. The Greeks in particular held
this view and had already identified Osiris, god of the world beyond
death, with their Dionysus, who was a god of mysteries and also of wine.
So when Ptolemy Soter decided to compound a god for his new city, he was
only taking advantage of this tendency, and giving a local habitation
and a name and a statue to sentiments that already existed.

Osiris was the main ingredient. He was already worshipped on the hill of
Rhakotis, and he was the most celebrated of the Egyptian deities. To him
was added the bull god Apis, of Memphis, whose cult had been recently
revived, and out of their names was formed the compound, “Serapis.” But
while the origins and title of the new god were Egyptian, his appearance
and attributes were Greek. His statue—ascribed to the Greek sculptor
Bryaxis—showed him seated in Greek garments upon a classic throne. His
features were those of the bearded Zeus, but softened and benign; indeed
he more closely resembled Aesculapius, god of Healing, to whom in a
civilised age men naturally turned. The basket on his head showed that
he was a harvest god, the three-headed Cerberus stood by his side to
show that he represented Pluto, god of the underworld.

The Ptolemies could launch such a being without any fear of wounding
religious susceptibilities. What they could not have foreseen was his
success. Serapis not only fulfilled their immediate political aim of
providing the Alexandrians with a common cult. He spread beyond the
city, beyond Egypt, and shrines to him arose all over the Mediterranean
world. Osiris-Apis-Dionysus-Zeus-Aesculapius-Pluto may seem to us an
artificial compound, but it stood the test of time, it satisfied men’s
desires, and was to be the last stronghold of Paganism against
Christianity.

The Temple stood on the old citadel of Rhakotis, where “Pompey’s Pillar”
rises to-day. It was in the midst of a cloister, and colonnades
connected it with each of the cloister’s sides. The architecture was
Greek: a large hall, and, at the end, the shrine with the god’s statue.
As the centuries passed, other buildings were added, and the second and
greater of the two Alexandrian libraries—the “Daughter”—was arranged in
them.

(v). THE ROYAL TOMBS.

The “Soma” of Alexander became so famous that the earlier Ptolemies were
buried close to it, and a mass of building—probably Greek in
architecture—arose where the present Rue Rosette and Rue Nebi Daniel
intersect. Later on, the burial place seems to have been in the Palace
enclosure, and perhaps the “Mausoleum” where Cleopatra died was on the
promontory of Silsileh, by a little Temple of Isis, within sound of the
sea.

    PROMONTORY OF SILSILEH: p. 163

(vi). OTHER BUILDINGS.

Theatre and Racecourse. Both were near the Palace: the former was
probably on the site of the present Egyptian Government Hospital. Their
architecture was Greek.

The Dyke of the Heptastadion was part of Alexander’s scheme. But the
Ptolemies completed it and fortified it where it rested on the Island of
Pharos.

    EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL (Site of Theatre): p. 162

Such were the chief buildings and institutions that arose during the
first hundred years of the city’s life. Additions were made—notably the
“Caesareum,” begun by Cleopatra. But on the whole it may be said that
Alexandria was the product of a single scheme, laid down by Dinocrates
and executed by the first three Ptolemies, and that she exhibited all
the advantages, and perhaps some of the drawbacks, of a town that has
been carefully planned. There was the majesty of well considered
effects; but there also may have been a little dullness, and there were
certainly none of the mysterious touches that reminded Athens and even
Rome of an unanalysable past. In one sense the place was more Greek than
Greece—built at a date when the Hellenic spirit had freed itself from
many illusions and was winning a command over material forces that it
had never possessed before. To her also Romance was added in time; but
she started brand new, gleaming white, a calculated marvel of marble.
Everything in her had been thought out—even her religion.




                   THE LATER PTOLEMIES (B.C. 221-51).

                    (_See Genealogical Tree p._ 12).


After the death of Euergetes, the dynasty declines: Some of his
successors were able men, but a type evolved that made neither for
morality nor for success. The average later Ptolemy is soft; he has the
artistic temperament but no passionate love of art; he is born in the
Palace at Alexandria and spends all his time there—so much so that it
was not known for a year that Ptolemy IV had died; not naturally cruel,
he is easily hurried into cruelty; he is unexpectedly shy; in his old
age he grows fat, so that the Roman envoy murmurs “at all events the
Alexandrians have seen their king walk” when Ptolemy VII comes puffing
to greet him along the quay. And as the men soften, the women harden.
The dynasty is interwoven with terrific queens. There is the Arsinoe
whom Philadelphus married; there is Arsinoe III who faced the Syrian
army at Rafa; there is Cleopatra III who murdered her son; and there is
the last and greatest Cleopatra, with whom the tangled race expires.

In contrast to this confusion there rises the solid but unattractive
figure of Rome (first embassy B.C. 273, first intervention B.C. 200).
Her advance was postponed until she had gained the Western Mediterranean
by defeating Carthage. She then came forward with studied politeness as
the protector of liberty and morals in the East. Legal and
self-righteous, she struck a chill into the whole Hellenistic world. She
was horrified at its corruption—a corruption of which she never failed
to take advantage, and the shattered empire of Alexander fell piece by
piece into her hands. The Ptolemies were the allies of this impeccable
creature—a curious alliance, but it lasted over 200 years. As the
Egyptian fleet and army decayed, Rome’s ministrations multiplied. She
declared herself guardian of the dynasty; then that one of the Ptolemies
had bequeathed Egypt to her in a will that she never produced. The
dynasty became, with Ptolemy XIII, illegitimate, and Rome made him pay
her to recognise his legitimacy. When he was driven from Egypt (B.C. 89)
she made him pay her to restore him. He was escorted back by an army of
creditors, and to raise the necessary sum of ten thousand talents he had
to grind down the people with taxes. Rome was shocked, but firm.

Against this relentless advance Alexandria could do nothing. She was the
brain of Egypt, and its five senses too and, as each embassy touched her
quays, she realised, as the priest-ridden towns of the interior could
not, that the glory was departing from the Nile. There was only one
hope. Would Rome, before she could annex Egypt, fall to pieces herself?
There were signs of it. The victorious republic had absorbed more
plunder and more ideas than she could conveniently digest. She had
always found it particularly difficult to digest an idea. Rival
Ptolemies had contended in Alexandria. But rival Romans were now
contending in Rome. Might it be possible to play off against one the
other, and so win through to safety? The scheme commended itself to the
Alexandrians. It also occurred to the daughter of the bankrupt Ptolemy
XIII, a beautiful and amusing princess called Cleopatra.

                        CLEOPATRA (B.C. 51-30).

                    (_See Genealogical Tree p._ 12).


The girl who came to the throne as Cleopatra VI Philopator was only
seventeen. Her brother and husband Ptolemy XIV was ten; her younger
brother eight, her sister fifteen. The palace at Alexandria became a
nursery, where four clever children watched the duel that was proceeding
between Pompey and Caesar beyond the seas. Pompey was their guardian,
but they had no illusions, either about him or one another. All they
cared for was life and power. Cleopatra failed in her first intrigue,
which was directed against her husband. He expelled her, and in her
absence the duel was concluded. Pompey, defeated by Caesar, drifted to
Egypt, threw himself on the mercy of his wards, and was murdered by
their agents as he disembarked.

With the arrival of Caesar, Cleopatra’s triumphs began. She did not
differ in character from the other able and unscrupulous queens of her
race, but she had one source of power that they denied themselves—the
power of the courtesan—and she exploited it professionally. Though
passionate, she was not the slave of passion, still less of
sentimentality. Her safety, and the safety of Egypt were her care; the
clumsy and amorous Romans, who menaced both, were her natural prey. In
old times, a queen might rule from her throne. Now she must descend and
play the woman. Having heard that Caesar was quartered at the Palace,
Cleopatra returned to Alexandria, rolled herself up in a bale of
oriental carpets and was smuggled to him in this piquant wrapper. The
other children protested, but her first victory had been won; she could
count on the support of Julius Caesar against her husband.

Caesar’s own position, was, however, most insecure. He was Lord of the
World, but in his haste to catch Pompey he had hurried ahead of his
legions. When the glamour of his arrival had worn off the Alexandrians
realised this, and in a fierce little war (Aug. 48—Jan. 47) tried to
crush him before reinforcements arrived. He held the Palace (near
Chatby) the Theatre (Egyptian Government Hospital); also part of the
Eastern Harbour where his small fleet lay. They held the rest of the
town, including the Western Harbour and the Island, and they had with
them Cleopatra’s sister who had escaped from the palace and, later,
Ptolemy XIV himself,—so that they could claim to represent the dynasty.

It was indeed a national rising against the Romans and ably conducted.
Five stages (_see_ Map. p. 98).

    (1). _Siege of the Palace._—This was succeeding by land but failed
    by sea, when Caesar, making a sudden excursion down the docks of the
    Eastern Harbour, set fire to the Alexandrian fleet. The flames
    spread to the Mouseion and the Library (“Mother” Library) was burnt.
    An attempt to contaminate the palace water supply also failed; when
    the Alexandrians pumped salt water into the conduit, the besieged
    Romans bored wells in the Palace enclosure.

    (2). _First Naval Engagement._—Caesar’s reinforcements had begun to
    arrive, and a heavy east wind had carried them past the entrance of
    his harbour. He went out to tow them in, and the Alexandrians issued
    from their own harbour—the Western—to intercept him. They failed.

    (3). _Second Naval Engagement and loss of the Island of
    Pharos._—Issuing from his harbour, Caesar rounded Ras-el-Tin and
    deployed outside the line of reefs that stretch from it to Agame and
    guard the entrance to the Western Harbour. The Alexandrians waited
    inside. Dashing through the entrance he pressed them against the
    quays of Rhakotis and defeated them. Now he could attack the Island
    on both sides. On the following day it fell and he made it his
    headquarters, thus changing the strategy of the war.

    (4). _Battle of the Dyke._—Caesar now blocked up the arches that
    penetrated the Heptastadion so that the Alexandrians could not
    manœuvre from harbour to harbour. Then he tried to force his way
    into the town. He employed too many troops, and landing in his rear
    the Alexandrians threw him into confusion. He himself had to jump
    from the dyke and swim to a boat. Victory. They recaptured the whole
    of the Heptastadion and reopened its arches.

    (5). _Battle by the Nile._—The war was after all decided outside
    Alexandria. More reinforcements were coming to Caesar down the
    Canopic mouth of the Nile and the Alexandrians marched out to
    intercept them there. The young Ptolemy XIV was their general now.
    He was defeated and drowned, his army was destroyed, and Caesar
    returned in triumph to its city and to Cleopatra.

Cleopatra’s fortune now seemed assured. Having married her younger
brother (as Ptolemy XV) she went for a trip with Caesar up the Nile to
show him its antiquities. The Egyptians detested her as their betrayer
but she was indifferent. She bore Caesar a son and followed him to Rome,
there to display her insolence. She was at the height of her beauty and
power when the blow fell. On the Ides of March, B.C. 44, Caesar was
murdered. She had chosen the wrong lover after all.

Back in Alexandria again, she watched the second duel—that between Mark
Antony and Caesar’s murderers. She helped neither party, and when Antony
won he summoned her to explain her neutrality. She came, not in a carpet
but in a gilded barge, and her life henceforward belongs less to history
than to poetry. It is almost impossible to think of the later Cleopatra
as an ordinary person. She has joined the company of Helen and Iseult.
Yet her character remained the same. Voluptuous but watchful, she
treated her new lover as she had treated her old. She never bored him,
and since grossness means monotony she sharpened his mind to those more
delicate delights, where sense verges into spirit. Her infinite variety
lay in that. She was the last of a secluded and subtle race, she was a
flower that Alexandria had taken three hundred years to produce and that
eternity cannot wither, and she unfolded herself to a simple but
intelligent Roman soldier.

Alexandria, now reconciled to her fate and protected by the legions of
Antony, became the capital of the Eastern world. The Western belonged to
Octavian, Caesar’s nephew, and a third duel was inevitable. It was
postponed for some years, during which Antony acquired and deserted a
Roman wife, and Cleopatra bore him several children. Her son by Julius
Caesar was crowned as Ptolemy XVI, with the additional title of King of
Kings. Antony himself became a God, and she built a temple to him,
afterwards called the Caesareum, and adorned by two ancient obelisks
(Cleopatra’s Needles). This period of happiness and splendour ended in
the naval disaster of Actium in the Adriatic, where Octavian defeated
their combined fleets. The defeat was hastened by Cleopatra’s cowardice.
At the decisive moment she fled with sixty ships, actually breaking her
way through Antony’s line from the rear, and throwing it into confusion.
He followed her to Alexandria, and there, when the recriminations had
ceased, they resumed their life of pleasures that were both shadowed and
sharpened by the approach of death. They made no attempt to oppose the
pursuing Octavian. Instead, they formed a Suicide Club, and Antony, to
imitate the misanthrope Timon, built a hermitage in the Western Harbour
which he called Timonium. Nor was religion silent. The god Hercules,
whom he loved and who loved him, was heard passing away from Alexandria
one night in exquisite music and song.

Arrival of Octavian. He is one of the most odious of the world’s
successful men and to his cold mind the career of Cleopatra could appear
as nothing but a vulgar debauch. Vice, in his opinion, should be
furtive. At his approach, Antony after resisting outside the Canopic
Gate (at “Caesar’s Camp”) retreated into the city and fell upon his
sword. He was carried, dying, to Cleopatra, who had retired into their
tomb, and their story now rises to the immortality of art. Shakespeare
drew his inspiration from Plutarch, who was himself inspired, and it is
difficult through their joint emotion to realise the actual facts. The
asp, for example, the asp is not a certainty. It was never known how
Cleopatra died. She was captured and taken to Octavian, with whom even
in Antony’s life-time she had been intriguing, for the courtesan in her
persisted. She appeared this time not in a carpet nor yet in a barge,
but upon a sofa, in the seductive negligence of grief. The good young
man was shocked. Realising that he intended to lead her in his triumph
at Rome, realising too that she was now thirty-nine years old, she
killed herself. She was buried in the tomb with Antony; and her ladies
Charmion and Iras, who died with her, guarded its doors as statues of
bronze. Alexandria became the capital of a Roman Province.

Thus the career of the Greco-Egyptian city closes, as it began, in an
atmosphere of Romance. Cleopatra is of course a meaner figure than
Alexander the Great. Ambition with her is purely selfish; with Alexander
it was mystically connected with the welfare of mankind. She knows
nothing beyond the body and so shrinks from discomfort and pain:
Alexander attained the strength of the hero. Yet for all their
differences, the man who created and the woman who lost Alexandria have
one element in common: monumental greatness; and between them is
suspended, like a rare and fragile chain, the dynasty of the Ptolemies.
It is a dynasty much censored by historians, but the Egyptians, who
lived under it, were more tolerant. For it had one element of greatness:
it did represent the complex country that it ruled. In Upper Egypt it
carried on the tradition of the Pharaohs: on the coast it was
Hellenistic and in touch with Mediterranean culture. After its
extinction, the vigour of Alexandria turns inwards. She is to do big
things in philosophy and religion. But she is no longer the capital of a
kingdom, no longer Royal.




                           PTOLEMAIC CULTURE.


Before leaving the Ptolemies, let us glance back at their civilisation.
We have seen how they founded two great institutions, the Palace and the
Mouseion, which communicated with one another, and which stretched from
the promontory of Silsileh to some point inland—as far as the modern
railway station, perhaps. It was in this area, among gardens and
colonnades, that the culture of Alexandria came into being. The Palace
provided the finances and called the tune: the Mouseion responded with
imagination or knowledge; the connection between them was so intimate as
almost to be absurd. When, for instance, Queen Berenice the wife of
Euergetes lost her hair from the temple where she had dedicated it, it
was the duty of the court astronomer to detect it as a constellation and
of the court poet to write an elegy thereon. And Stratonice, who was
perfectly bald, presented an even more delicate problem; she sent over a
message to the Mouseion that something must be written about her hair
also. Victory odes, Funeral dirges, Marriage hymns, jokes, genealogical
trees, medical prescriptions, mechanical toys, maps, engines of war:
whatever the Palace required it had only to inform the Mouseion, and the
subsidised staff set to work at once. The poets and scientists there did
nothing that would annoy the Royal Family and not much that would puzzle
it, for they knew that if they failed to give satisfaction they would be
expelled from the enchanted area, and have to find another patron or
starve. It was not an ideal arrangement, as outsiders were prompt to
point out, and snobbery and servility taint the culture of Alexandria
from the first. It sprang up behind walls, it never knew loneliness, nor
the glories and the dangers of independence, and the marvel is that it
flourished as well as it did. At all events it is idle to criticise it
for not being different, for if it had been different it would not have
been Alexandrian. In spirit as in fact the Palace and the Mouseion
touched, and the Palace was the stronger and the older. The contact
strangled Philosophy and deprived Literature of such sustenance as
Philosophy can bring to her. But it encouraged Science and gave even to
Literature certain graces that she had hitherto ignored.

    THEOCRITUS, about 320-250.


The literature that grew up in the Mouseion had no lofty aims. It was
not interested in ultimate problems nor even in problems of behaviour,
and it attempted none of the higher problems of art. To be graceful or
pathetic or learned or amusing or indecent, and in any case loyal—this
sufficed it, so that though full of experiments it is quite devoid of
adventure. It developed when the heroic age of Greece was over, when
liberty was lost and possibly honour too. It was disillusioned, and we
may be glad that is was not embittered also. It had strength of a kind,
for it saw that out of the wreck of traditional hopes three good things
remained—namely the decorative surface of the universe, the delights of
study, and the delights of love, and that of these three the best was
love. Ancient Greece had also sung of love, but with restraint,
regarding it as one activity among many. The Alexandrians seldom sang of
anything else: their epigrams, their elegies and idylls, their one great
epic, all turn on the tender passion, and celebrate it in ways that
previous ages had never known, and that future ages were to know too
well. Darts and hearts, sighs and eyes, breasts and chests, all
originated in Alexandria and from the intercourse between Palace and
Mouseion—stale devices to-day, but then they were fresh.

    Who sculptured Love and set him by the pool,
    thinking with water such a fire to cool?[2]

runs a couplet ascribed to one of the early Librarians, and containing
in brief the characteristics of the school—decorative method,
mythological allusiveness, and the theme of love. Love as a cruel and
wanton boy flits through the literature of Alexandria as through the
thousands of terra cotta statuettes that have been exhumed from her
soil; one tires of him, but it is appropriate that he should have been
born under a dynasty that culminated in Cleopatra.

Literature took its tone from Callimachus—a fine poet, though not as
fine as his patrons supposed. He began life as a schoolmaster at Eleusis
(the modern Nouzha) and then was called to the Mouseion, where he became
Librarian under Euergetes. His learning was immense, his wit
considerable, his loyalty untiring. It was he who wrote the poem about
Berenice’s hair. Dainty and pedantic in all that he did, he announced
that “a big book is a big nuisance” and cared more about neatness of
expression than depth of feeling, though the feeling emerges in his
famous epigram:

    Someone told me, Heracleitus, of your end;
      and I wept, and thought how often you and I
      sunk the sun with talking. Well! and now you lie
    antiquated ashes somewhere, Carian friend.
      But your nightingales, your songs, are living still;
      them the death that clutches all things cannot kill.[2]

Only once was this exquisite career interrupted. There was among his
pupils a young man from Rhodes with thin legs, by name Apollonius.
Apollonius was ambitious to write an Epic—a form of composition detested
by Callimachus, and opposed to all his theories. In vain he objected;
Apollonius, then only eighteen, gave in the Mouseion a public reading of
the preliminary draft of his poem. A violent quarrel was the result,
Apollonius was expelled, and Callimachus wrote a satire called the Ibis,
in which his rival’s legs and other deficiencies were exposed. The
friends of Apollonius retorted with equal spirit, and the tranquillity
of the Mouseion was impaired. Callimachus won, but his victory was not
eternal; after his death Apollonius was recalled to Alexandria, and in
time became librarian there in his turn.

The Epic Apollonius insisted on writing has survived. It is modelled on
Homer and deals with the voyage of the Argo to recover the Golden
Fleece. But there is nothing Homeric in the treatment and though we are
supposed to be in barbaric lands we never really leave the cultivated
court of the Ptolemies. Love is still the ruling interest. He slips, the
naughty little boy, into the Palace of Medea, and shoots his tiny dart
at her, to inspire her with passion for Jason. So might he have inspired
Queen Berenice or Arsinoe. Pains, languors, and raptures succeed, and
the theme of the heroic quest is forgotten. Callimachus can have found
nothing to object to in such a poem except its length, for it is typical
of his school. Its pictorial method is also characteristic of
Alexandria; many of the episodes might be illustrated by terra cotta
statues and gems.

But one of the poets who worked in the Mouseion—Theocritus—was a genius
of a very different kind, a genius that Alexandria matured but cannot be
said to have formed. Theocritus came here late in his career. He had
been born at Cos and had lived in Sicily, and he arrived full of
memories that no town-dweller could share—memories of fresh air and the
sun, of upland meadows and overhanging trees, of goats and sheep, of the
men and the women who looked after them, and of all the charm and the
coarseness that go to make up country life. He had thrown these memories
into poetical form, sometimes idealising them, sometimes giving them
crudely, and he had called these poems Idylls—little pictures of rural
existence. Love, mythological fancies, decorative treatment—he liked
these things too, but he backed them with a width of experience and a
zest for it that Callimachus and Apollonius never knew. While they are
“Classics” who have to be studied, Theocritus appeals to us at once; his
Fifteenth Idyll, describing life in the Greek Quarter at Alexandria, is
as vivid now as when he wrote it. The dialogue with which it opens can
be heard to-day in any of the little drawing rooms of Camp de César or
Ibrahimieh. Praxinoe, a lady of the middle classes, is discovered
seated, doing nothing in particular. In comes Gorgo, her friend.

    _Gorgo._ Is Praxinoe at home?

    _Praxinoe._ Oh my dear Gorgo, it’s ages since you were here. She
    _is_ at home. The wonder is that you’ve come even now. (calls to the
    maid). Eunoe, give her a chair and put a cushion on it.

    _Gorgo._ Oh it does beautifully as it is.

    _Praxinoe._ Sit down!

    _G._ My nerves are all to bits—Praxinoe, I only just got here alive
    ... what with the crowd, what with the carriages ... soldiers’
    boots—soldiers’ great-coats, and the street’s endless—you really
    live too far.

    _P._ That’s my insane husband. We took this hut—one can’t call it a
    house—at the ends of the earth so that we shouldn’t be neighbours.
    Mere jealousy. As usual.

    _G._ But, dear, don’t talk about your husband when the little boy’s
    here—he’s staring at you. (to the little boy) Sweet pet—that’s all
    right—she isn’t talking about papa.—Good Heavens, the child
    understands.—Pretty papa!

    _P._ The other day, papa—we seem to call every day the other day—the
    other day he went to get some soda at the Baccal and brought back
    salt by mistake—the great overgrown lout.

    _G._ Mine’s exactly the same, he....[3]

And so on. But Gorgo wants to go out again, in spite of her nerves. It
is the Feast of the Resurrection—the Resurrection of Adonis—and there is
to be a magnificent service inside the Palace, with a special singer,
Praxinoe decides to venture too, and puts on the dress with the full
body, that cost “at least eight pounds,” excluding embroidery. They are
ready at last and then the little boy begins to scream; he wishes to be
of the party. But his mother remarks, “cry as much as you like, I cannot
have you lamed,” and takes Eunoe instead. In the street the crush is
terrific, they are terrified of the Egyptians (just like Greek ladies
to-day) and Eunoe, who is always awkward, nearly falls under a horse.
The battle at the Palace Gate is worse still, Praxinoe’s best muslin
veil is torn, and she is more thankful than ever that she did not bring
her little boy. But for a kind gentleman in the crowd, they would never
have got in. Once inside, all is enjoyment. The draperies are gorgeous
as might be expected when the Queen Arsinoe is paying for them—Arsinoe
the wife of Philadelphus. And here is a Holy Sepulchre on which lies an
image of Adonis, the down of early manhood just showing on his cheeks!
The ladies are in ecstacies and can scarcely quiet themselves to listen
to the Resurrection Hymn. In this Hymn Theocritus displays the other
side of his genius—the “Alexandrian” side. He is no longer the amusing
realist, but an erudite poet, whose chief theme is love.

    O Queen that lovest Golgi and Idalium and Eryx, O Aphrodite that
    playest with gold—lo from the everlasting stream of Hades they have
    brought thee back Adonis.... A bridegroom of eighteen or nineteen
    years is he, his kisses are not yet rough, the golden down being yet
    on his lips.... Thou only, dear Adonis, so men tell, visitest both
    this world and the stream of Hades. For Agamemnon had no such fate,
    nor Ajax the wrathful, nor Hector the first-born of Hecuba, nor
    Patroclus, nor Pyrrhus that returned out of Troy, nor the heroes of
    yet more ancient days.... Be gracious now, dear Adonis, and bless us
    in the coming year. Dear has thy resurrection been, and dear shall
    it be when thou comest again.

A beautiful hymn; but as Gorgo remarks “all the same it’s time to be
getting home; my husband hasn’t had his dinner and when he’s kept
waiting for his dinner he’s as sour as vinegar.” They salute the risen
god, and go.

This delightful Idyll is not quite characteristic of Theocritus—he
generally sings of Shepherds and their flocks. But it is his great
contribution to the literature of Alexandria, and our chief authority
for daily life under the Ptolemies. History is too much an affair of
armies and kings. The Fifteenth Idyll corrects the error. Only through
literature can the past be recovered and here Theocritus, wielding the
double spell of realism and of poetry, has evoked an entire city from
the dead and filled its streets with men. As Praxinoe remarks of the
draperies “Why the figures seem to stand up and to move, they’re not
patterns, they are alive.”

The Mouseion was at its best under the first three Ptolemies. Then it
declined—at least in its literary output—and though Alexandria turned
out poems, etc. for several hundred years, few of them merit attention.
With the coming of the Romans her genius took a new line, and essayed
the neglected paths of philosophy and religion. But she remained
attractive to men of letters, and nearly every writer of note visited
her in the course of his travels.

                            (B) SCHOLARSHIP.


In the Mouseion at Alexandria Greece first became aware of her literary
heritage, and the works of the past were not only collected in the
Library but were codified, amended, and explained. Scholarship dates
from Zenodotus, the first Librarian. He turned his attention to Homer,
divided the Iliad and Odyssey into “Books,” struck out spurious verses
from the text, marked doubtful ones, and introduced new readings. He
gave a general impulse to research. Hitherto the Greek language had
developed unnoticed. Now it was consciously examined, and the result of
the examination was the first Greek Grammar (about 100 B.C.). Grammar is
a valuable subject but also a dangerous one, for it naturally attracts
pedants and schoolmasters and all who think that Literature is an affair
of rules. And the Grammarians of Alexandria forgot that they were merely
codifying the usages of the past, and presumed to dictate to the
present, and to posterity; they set a bad example that has been followed
for nearly 2000 years. Greek accents—another doubtful boon—were also
invented in the Mouseion. Indeed the whole of literary scholarship, as
we know it, sprang up, including that curious by-product the Scholarly
Joke. For instance: one learned man wrote a poem that had, when
transcribed, the shape of a bird, another wrote a poem in the shape of a
double-headed axe, and a third re-wrote the whole of the Odyssey without
using the letter S. The donnish wit of the Mouseion infected the Palace,
and was practiced by the Ptolemies themselves. One scholar, Sosibius by
name, complained to King Philadelphus that he had not received his
salary. The King replied “The first syllable of your name occurs in
Soter, the second in Sosigenes, the third in Bion, and the fourth in
Apollonius; I have paid these four gentlemen, and therefore I have paid
you.”


                                (C) ART.


Unimportant. Alexandria had her special industries—_e.g._ glass, terra
cotta, “Egyptian Queen” pottery, and woven stuffs, and her mint was
famous; but for creative artists the Ptolemies looked over seas. Greek
and Egyptian motives did not blend in Art as they did in Religion;
attempts occur, but they are not notable and on the whole the city
follows the general Hellenistic tendencies of the time. These tendencies
led as we have seen away from the ideal and the abstract, and towards
portraiture and the dainty and the picturesque. Men had lost for the
time many illusions, both religious and political, and were trying to
beautify their private lives, and the tombs of those whom they had
loved.

                            (D) PHILOSOPHY.


Unimportant. The Ptolemies imported some second-rate disciples of
Aristotle to give tone to the Mouseion, but took no interest in the
subject, and were indeed averse to it, since it might lead to freedom of
thought. It was not until their dynasty was extinct that the great
school of Alexandrian Philosophy arose. (See p. 60, under heading “The
Spiritual City.”)


                              (E) SCIENCE.


The Ptolemies were more successful over Science than over Literature.
They preferred it, for it could not criticise their divine right. Its
endowment was the greatest achievement of the dynasty and makes
Alexandria famous until the end of time. Science had been studied in
Ancient Greece, but sporadically: there had been no co-ordination, no
laboratories, and though important truths might be discovered or
surmised, they were in danger of oblivion because they could not be
popularised. The foundation of the Mouseion changed all this. Working
under royal patronage and with every facility, science leapt to new
heights, and gave valuable gifts to mankind. The third century B.C. is
(from this point of view) the greatest period that civilisation has ever
known—greater even than the nineteenth century A.D. It did not bring
happiness or wisdom: science never does. But it explored the physical
universe and harnessed many powers for our use. Mathematics, Geography,
Astronomy, Medicine, all grew to maturity in the little space of the
land between the present Rue Rosette and the sea, and if we had any
sense of the fitting, some memorial to them would arise on the spot
to-day.

(i). MATHEMATICS.

Mathematics begin with the tremendous but obscure career of Euclid.
Nothing is known about Euclid: indeed one thinks of him to-day more as a
branch of knowledge than as a man. But Euclid was once alive, landing
here in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and informing that
superficial monarch that there is “no royal road to geometry.” Here he
composed, among other works, his “Elements” in which he incorporated all
previous knowledge, and which have remained the world’s text book for
Geometry almost down to the present day. Here he founded a mathematical
school that lasted 700 years, and acknowledged his leadership to the
last. Apollonius of Perga, who inaugurated the study of Conic Sections,
was his immediate pupil: Hyspicles added to the thirteen books of his
“Elements” two books more: and Theon—father to the martyred
Hypatia—edited the “Elements” and gave them their present form, so that
from first to last the mathematicians of Alexandria were preoccupied
with him. An insignificant man, according to tradition, and very shy;
his snub to Philadelphus seems to have been exceptional.

(ii). GEOGRAPHY.

In Geography there are two leading figures—Eratosthenes and Claudius
Ptolemy. Eratosthenes is the greater. He seems to have been an all round
genius, eminent in literature as well as science. He was born at Cyrene
in B.C. 276 and, on the death of Callimachus, was invited to Alexandria
to become librarian. It was in the Mouseion observatory that he measured
the Earth—perhaps not the greatest achievement of Alexandrian science,
but certainly the most thrilling. His method was as follows. He knew
that the earth is round, and he was told that the midsummer sun at
Assouan in Upper Egypt cast no shadow at midday. At Alexandria, at the
same moment, it did cast a shadow, Alexandria being further to the north
on the same longitude. On measuring the Alexandria shadow he found that
it was 7⅕ degrees—_i.e._ 1/50th of a complete circle—so that the
distance from Alexandria to Assouan must be 1/50th the circumference of
the Earth. He estimated the distance at 500 miles, and consequently
arrived at 250,000 miles for the complete circumference, and 7,850 for
the diameter; in the latter calculation he is only 50 miles out. It is
strange that when science had once gained such triumphs mankind should
ever have slipped back again into fairy tales and barbarism.

[Illustration: The World according To Claudius Ptolemy A.D. 100]


The other great work of Eratosthenes was his “Geographies,” including
all previous knowledge on the subject, just as the “Elements” of Euclid
had included all previous mathematical knowledge. The “Geographies” were
in three books, and to them was attached a map of the known world. (See
p. 37). It is, of course, full of inaccuracies—_e g._ Great Britain is
too large, India fails to be a peninsula and the Caspian Sea connects
with the Arctic Ocean. But it is conceived in the scientific spirit. It
represents the world as Eratosthenes thought it was, not as he thought
it ought to be. When he knows nothing, he inserts nothing; he is not
ashamed to leave blank spaces. He bases it on such facts as he knew, and
had he known more facts he would have altered it.

The other great geographer, Claudius Ptolemy, belongs to a later period
(A.D. 100) but it is convenient to notice him here. Possibly he was a
connection of the late royal family, but nothing is known of his life.
His fame has outshone Eratosthenes’, and no doubt he was more learned,
for more facts were at his disposal. Yet we can trace in him the decline
of the scientific spirit. Observe his Map of the World (p. 39). At first
sight it is superior to the Eratosthenes Map. The Caspian Sea is
corrected, new countries—_e.g._ China—are inserted, and there are (in
the original) many more names. But there is one significant mistake. He
has prolonged Africa into an imaginary continent and joined it up to
China. It was a mere flight of his fancy: he even scattered this
continent with towns and rivers. No one corrected the mistake and for
hundreds of years it was believed that the Indian Ocean was land bound.
The age of enquiry was over, and the age of authority had begun, and it
is worth noting that the decline of science at Alexandria exactly
coincides with the rise of Christianity.

(iii). ASTRONOMY AND THE CALENDAR.

Astronomy develops on the same lines as Geography. There is an early
period of scientific research under Eratosthenes, and there is a later
period in which Claudius Ptolemy codifies the results and dictates his
opinions to posterity. He announced, for example, that the Universe
revolves round the Earth, and this “Ptolemaic” Theory was adopted by all
subsequent astronomers until Galileo, and supported by all the thunders
of the Church. Yet another view had been put forward, though Ptolemy
ignores it. Aristarchus of Samos, working at Alexandria with
Eratosthenes, had suggested that the earth might revolve round the sun,
and it is only a chance that this view was not stamped as official and
imposed as orthodox all through the Middle Ages. We do not know what
Aristarchus’ arguments were, for his writings have perished, but we may
be sure that, working in the 3rd century B.C., he had arguments and did
not take refuge in authority. Astronomy under the Ptolemies was a
serious affair—lightened only by the episode of Berenice’s Hair.

As to the Calendar. The Calendar we now use was worked out in
Alexandria. The Ancient Egyptians had calculated the year at 365 days.
It is actually 365 ¼, so before long they were hopelessly out; the
official Harvest Festival, for instance, only coincided with the actual
harvest once in 1,500 years. They were aware of the discrepancy, but
were too conservative to alter it: that was left to Alexandria. In B.C.
239 the little daughter of Ptolemy Euergetes died, and the priests of
Serapis at Canopus passed a decree making her a goddess. A reformer even
in his grief, the King induced them to rectify the Calendar at the same
time by decreeing the existence of a Leap Year, to occur every four
years, as at present; he attempted to harmonise the traditions of Egypt
with the science of Greece. The attempt—so typical of Alexandria—failed,
for though the priests passed the decree they kept to their old
chronology. It was not until Julius Caesar came to Egypt that the cause
of reform prevailed. He established the “Alexandrian Year” as official,
and modelled on it the “Julian,” which we use in Europe to-day; the two
years were of the same length, but the “Alexandrian” retained the old
Egyptian arrangement of twelve equal months.

(iv). MEDICINE.

Erasistratus (3rd. cent. B.C.) is the chief glory of the Alexandrian
medical school. In his earlier life he had been a great practitioner,
and had realised the connection between sexual troubles and nervous
breakdowns. In his old age he settled in the Mouseion, and devoted
himself to research. He practised vivisection on animals, and possibly
on criminals, and he seems to have come near to discovering the
circulation of the blood. Less severely scientific were the healing
cults that sprang up in the great temples of Serapis, both at Alexandria
and at Canopus;—cults that were continued into Christian times under
other auspices.

                           CHRISTIAN PERIOD.




                  THE RULE OF ROME (B.C. 30—A.D. 313).


Octavian (Augustus) the founder of the Roman Empire, so disliked
Alexandria that after his triumph over Cleopatra he founded a town near
modern Ramleh—Nicopolis, the “City of Victory.” He also forbade any
Roman of the governing classes to enter Egypt without his permission, on
the ground that the religious orgies there would corrupt their morals.
The true reason was economic. He wanted to keep the Egyptian corn supply
in his own hands, and thus control the hungry populace of Rome. Egypt,
unlike the other Roman provinces, became a private appanage of the
Emperor, who himself appointed the Prefect who governed it, and
Alexandria turned into a vast imperial granary where the tribute,
collected in kind from the cultivators, was stored for transhipment. It
was an age of exploitation. Octavian posed locally as the divine
successor of the Ptolemies, and appears among hieroglyphs at Dendyra and
Philae. But he had no local interest at heart.

After his death things improved. The harsh ungenerous Republic that he
had typified passed into Imperial Rome, who, despite her moments of
madness, brought happiness to the Mediterranean world for two hundred
years. Alexandria had her share of this happiness. Her new problem—riots
between Greeks and Jews—was solved at the expense of the latter; she
gained fresh trade by the improved connections with India (Trajan A.D.
115, recut the Red Sea Canal); she was visited by a series of
appreciative Emperors on their way to the antiquities of Upper Egypt.

In about A.D. 250 she, with the rest of the Empire, reentered trouble.
The human race, as if not designed to enjoy happiness, had slipped into
a mood of envy and discontent. Barbarians attacked the frontiers of the
Empire, while within were revolts and mutinies. The difficulties of the
Emperors were complicated by a religious problem. They had, for
political reasons, been emphasising their own divinity—a divinity that
Egypt herself had taught them: it seemed to them that it would be a
binding force against savagery and schism. They therefore directed that
everyone should worship them. Who could have expected a protest, and a
protest from Alexandria?

                        THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.


According to the tradition of the Egyptian Church, Christianity was
introduced into Alexandria by St. Mark, who in A.D. 45 converted a
Jewish shoemaker named Annianus, and who in 62 was martyred for
protesting against the worship of Serapis. There is no means of checking
this tradition; the origins of the movement were unfashionable and
obscure, and the authorities took little notice of it until it disobeyed
their regulations. Its doctrines were confounded partly with the Judaism
from which they had sprung, partly with the other creeds of the city. A
letter ascribed to the emperor Hadrian (in Alexandria 134) says “Those
who worship Serapis are Christians, and those who call themselves
bishops of Christ are devoted to Serapis,” showing how indistinct was
the impression that the successors of St. Mark had made. The letter
continues “As a race of men they are seditious, vain, and spiteful; as a
body, wealthy and prosperous, of whom nobody lives in idleness. Some
blow glass, some make paper, and others linen. Their one God is nothing
peculiar; Christians, Jews, and all nations worship him. I wish this
body of men was better behaved.”

The community was organised under its “overseer” or bishop, who soon
took the title of patriarch, and appointed bishops elsewhere in Egypt.
The earliest centres were (i) the oratory of St. Mark which stood by the
sea shore—probably to the east of Silsileh—and was afterwards enlarged
into a Cathedral; (ii) a later cathedral church dedicated (285) by the
Patriarch Theonas to the Virgin Mary; it was on the site of the present
Franciscan Church by the Docks. (iii) a Theological College—the
“Catechetical School,” founded about 200, where Clement of Alexandria
and Origen taught—site unknown.

It was its “bad behaviour,” to use Hadrian’s term, that brought the
community into notice—that is to say, its refusal to worship the
Emperors. To the absurd spiritual claims of the state, Christianity
opposed the claims of the individual conscience, and the conflict was
only allayed by the state itself becoming Christian. The conflict came
to its height in Alexandria, which, more than any other city in the
Empire, may claim to have won the battle for the new religion.
Persecution, at first desultory, grew under Decius, and culminated in
the desperate measures of Diocletian (303)—demolition of churches, all
Christian officials degraded, all Christian non-officials enslaved.
Diocletian, an able ruler—the great column miscalled Pompey’s is his
memorial—did not persecute from personal spite, but the results were no
less appalling and definitely discredited the pagan state. While we need
not accept the Egyptian Church’s estimate of 144,000 martyrs in nine
years, there is no doubt that numbers perished in all ranks of society.
Among the victims was St. Menas, a young Egyptian soldier who became
patron of the desert west of Lake Mariout, where a great church was
built over his grave. St. Catherine of Alexandria is also said to have
died under Diocletian, but it is improbable that she ever lived; she and
her wheel were creations of Western Catholicism, and the land of her
supposed sufferings has only recognised her out of politeness to the
French. The persecution was vain, the state was defeated, and the
Egyptian Church, justly triumphant, dates its chronology, not from the
birth of Christ, but from the “Era of Martyrs” (A.D. 284). A few years
later the Emperor Constantine made Christianity official, and the menace
from without came to an end.

                         ARIUS AND ATHANASIUS.
                            (4th Cent. A.D.)


It was natural that Alexandria, who had suffered so much for
Christianity, should share in its triumph, and as soon as universal
toleration was proclaimed her star reemerged. Rome, as the stronghold of
Paganism, was discredited, and it seemed that the city by the Nile might
again become Imperial, as in the days of Antony. That hoped was dashed,
for Constantine, a very cautious man, thought it safer to found a new
capital on the Bosphorus, where no memories from the past could intrude.
But Alexandria was the capital spiritually, and at least it seemed that
she, who had helped to free imprisoned Christendom, would lead it in
harmony and peace to its home at the feet of God. That hope was dashed
too. An age of hatred and misery was approaching. The Christians, as
soon as they had captured the machinery of the pagan state, turned it
against one another, and the century resounds to a dispute between two
dictatorial clergymen.

Both were natives of Alexandria. Arius, the older, took duty at St.
Mark’s—the vanished church by the sea at Chatby where the Evangelist was
said to have been martyred. Learned and sincere, tall, simple in his
dress, persuasive in his speech, he was accused by his enemies of
looking like a snake, and of seducing, in the theological sense, 700
virgins. Athanasius, his opponent, first appears as a merry little boy,
playing with other children on the beach below St. Theonas’—on the shore
of the present western harbour, that is to say. He was playing at
Baptism, which not being in orders he had no right to do, and the
Patriarch, who happened to be looking out of the palace window, tried to
stop him. No one ever succeeded in stopping St. Athanasius. He baptised
his playmates, and the Patriarch, struck by his precocity, recognised
the sacrament as valid and engaged the active young theologian as his
secretary. Physically Athanasius was blackish and small, but strong and
extremely graceful—one recognises a modern street type. His character
can scarcely be discerned through the dust of the century, but he was
certainly not loveable, though he lived to be a popular hero. His powers
were remarkable. As a theologian he knew what is true, and as a
politician he knew how truth can be enforced, and his career blends
subtlety with vigour and self-abnegation with craft in the most
remarkable way.

The dispute—Arius started it—concerned the nature of Christ. Its
doctrinal import is discussed below (p. 75); here we are only dealing
with the outward results. Constantine who was no theologian and
dubiously Christian, was appalled by the schism which rapidly divided
his empire. He wrote, counselling charity, and when he was ignored
summoned the disputants to Nicaea on the Black Sea (325). Two hundred
and fifty bishops and many priests attended, and amid great violence the
_Nicene Creed_ was passed, and Arius condemned. Athanasius who was still
only a deacon, returned in triumph to Alexandria, and soon afterwards
became Patriarch here. But his troubles were only beginning.
Constantine, still obsessed with hopes of toleration, asked him to
receive Arius back. He refused, and was banished himself.

He was banished five times in all—once by the orthodox Constantine
(335), twice by the Arian Constantius (338 and 356), once by the pagan
Julian (362), and once, shortly before his death, by the Arian Valens.
Sometimes he hid in the Lybian desert, sometimes he escaped to Rome or
Palestine and made Christendom ring with his grievances. Twice he came
near to death in church—once in the Caesareum where he marched
processionally out of one door as the enemy came in at the other, and
once in St. Theonas at night, where he escaped from the altar just
before the Arian soldiers murdered him there. He always returned, and he
had the supreme joy of outliving Arius, who fell down dead one evening,
while walking through Alexandria with a friend. To us, living in a
secular age, such triumphs appear remote, and it seems better to die
young, like Alexander the Great, than to drag out this arid theological
Odyssey. But Athanasius has the immortality that he would have desired.
Owing to his efforts the Church has accepted as final his opinion on the
nature of Christ, and, duly grateful, has recognised him as a doctor and
canonised him as a saint. In Alexandria a large church was built to
commemorate his name. It stood on the north side of the Canopic Street;
the Attarine Mosque occupies part of its site to-day.

                         THE RULE OF THE MONKS.
                          (4th and 5th Cents.)

    THEOPHILUS.
    CYRIL.
    DIOSCURUS.


After the exploits of Athanasius the Patriarchate of Alexandria became
very powerful. In theory Egypt belonged to the Emperor, who sent a
Prefect and a garrison from Constantinople; in practise it was ruled by
the Patriarch and his army of monks. The monks had not been important so
long as each lived alone, but by the 4th cent., they had gathered into
formidable communities, whence they would occasionally make raids on
civilisation like the Bedouins to-day. One of these communities was only
nine miles from Alexandria (the “Ennaton”), others lay further west, in
the Mariout desert; of those in the Wady Natrun, remnants still survive.
The monks had some knowledge of theology and of decorative craft, but
they were averse to culture and incapable of thought. Their heroes were
St. Ammon who deserted his wife on their wedding eve, or St. Antony, who
thought bathing sinful and was consequently carried across the canals of
the delta by an angel. From the ranks of such men the Patriarchs were
recruited.

Christianity, which had been made official at the beginning of the 4th
century, was made compulsory towards its close, and this gave the monks
the opportunity of attacking the worship of Serapis. Much had now taken
refuge in that ancient Ptolemaic shrine—philosophy, magic, learning,
licentiousness. The Patriarch Theophilus led the attack. The Serapis
temple at Canopus (Aboukir) fell in 389, the parent temple at Alexandria
two years later; great was the fall of the latter, for it involved the
destruction of the Library whose books had been stored in the cloisters
surrounding the buildings; a monastery was installed on the site. The
persecution of the pagans continued, and culminated in the murder of
Hypatia (415). The achievements of Hypatia, like her youthfulness, have
been exaggerated; she was a middle-aged lady who taught mathematics at
the Mouseion and though she was a philosopher too we have no record of
her doctrines. The monks were now supreme, and one of them had murdered
the Imperial Prefect, and had been canonised for the deed by the
Patriarch Cyril. Cyril’s wild black army filled the streets, “human only
in their faces,” and anxious to perform some crowning piety before they
retired to their monasteries. In this mood they encountered Hypatia who
was driving from a lecture (probably along the course of the present Rue
Nebi Daniel), dragged her from the carriage to the Caesareum, and there
tore her to pieces with tiles. She is not a great figure. But with her
the Greece that is a spirit expired—the Greece that tried to discover
truth and create beauty and that had created Alexandria.

The monks however, have another aspect. They were the nucleus of a
national movement. Nationality did not exist in the modern sense—it was
a religious not a patriotic age. But under the cloak of religion racial
passions could shelter, and the monks killed Hypatia not only because
they knew she was sinful but also because they thought she was foreign.
They were anti-Greek, and later on they and their lay adherents were
given the name of Copts. “Copt” means “Egyptian.” The language of the
Copts was derived from the ancient Egyptian, their script was Greek,
with the addition of six letters adapted from the hieroglyphs. The new
movement permeated the whole country, even cosmopolitan Alexandria, and
as soon as it found a theological formula in which to express itself, a
revolt against Constantinople broke out.

That formula is known as “Monophysism.” Its theological import—it
concerns the Nature of Christ—is discussed below (p. 76); here we are
concerned with its outward effects. The Patriarch Dioscurus, successor
and nephew to Cyril, is the first Monophysite hero and the real founder
of the Coptic Church. The Emperor took up a high and mighty line, and at
the Council of Chalcedon near Constantinople Dioscurus was exiled and
his doctrines condemned (451). From that moment no Greek was safe in
Egypt. The racial trouble, which had been averted by the Ptolemies,
broke out at last and has not even died down to-day. Before long
Alexandria was saddled with two Patriarchs. There was (i) The Orthodox
or “Royal” Patriarch, who upheld the decrees of Chalcedon. He was
appointed by the Emperor and had most of the Church revenues. But he had
no spiritual authority over the Egyptians; to them he was an odious
Greek official, disguised as a priest. (ii) The Monophysite or Coptic
Patriarch, who opposed Chalcedon—a regular Egyptian monk, poor, bigoted
and popular. Each of these Patriarchs claimed to represent St. Mark and
the only true church; each of them is represented by a Patriarch in
Alexandria to-day. Now and then an Emperor tried to heal the schism, and
made concessions to the Egyptian faith. But the schism was racial, the
concessions theological, so nothing was effected. Egypt was only held
for the Empire by Greek garrisons, and consequently when the Arabs came
they conquered her at once.

                        THE ARAB CONQUEST (641).


We are now approaching the catastrophe. Its details though dramatic are
confusing. It took place during the reign of the Emperor Heraclius, and
we must begin by glancing at his curious career.

Heraclius was an able and sensitive man—very sensitive, very much in the
grip of his own moods. Sometimes he appears as a hero, a great
administrator; sometimes as an apathetic recluse. He won his empire
(610) by the sword; then the reaction came and he allowed the Persians
to occupy Syria and Egypt almost without striking a blow. Alexandria
fell by treachery. She was safe on the seaward side, for the Persians
had no fleet, and her immense walls made her impregnable by land; their
army (which was encamped near Mex) could burn monasteries but do nothing
more. But a foreign student—Peter was his name—got into touch with them
and revealed the secrets of her topography. A canal ran through her from
the Western Harbour, rather to the north of the present (Mahmoudieh)
canal, and it passed, by a bridge, under the Canopic Way (present Rue
Sidi Metwalli). The harbour end of the Canal was unguarded, and a few
Persians, at Peter’s advice, disguised themselves as fishermen and rowed
in; then walked westward down the Canopic Way and unbarred the Gate of
the Moon to the main army (617). Their rule was not cruel; though
sun-worshippers, they persecuted neither orthodox Christians nor Copts.
For five years Heraclius did nothing; then shook off his torpor and
performed miracles. Marching against the armies of the Persians in Asia,
he defeated them and recovered the relic of the True Cross, which they
had taken from Jerusalem. Alexandria and Egypt were freed, and at the
festival of the Exaltation of the Cross—his coins commemorate it—the
Emperor appeared as the champion of Christendom and the greatest ruler
in the world. It is unlikely that in the hour of his triumph he paid any
attention to the envoys of an obscure Arab Sheikh named Mohammed, who
came to congratulate him on his victory and to suggest that he should
adopt a new religion called “Peace” or “Islam.” But he is said to have
dismissed them politely. The same Sheikh also sent envoys to the
Imperial viceroy at Alexandria. He too was polite and sent back a
present that included an ass, a mule, a bag of money, some butter and
honey, and two Coptic maidens. One of the latter, Mary, became the
Sheikh’s favourite concubine. Amidst such amenities did our intercourse
with Mohammedanism begin.

Heraclius, now at the height of his power and with a mind now vigorous,
turned next to the religious problem. He desired that his empire should
be spiritually as it was physically one, and in particular that the feud
in Egypt should cease. He was not a bigot. He believed in tolerance, and
sought a formula that should satisfy both orthodox and Copts—both the
supporters and the opponents of the Council of Chalcedon. A disastrous
search. He had better have let well alone. The formula that he
found—Monothelism—was so obscure that no one could understand it, and
the man whom he chose as its exponent was a cynical bully, who did not
even wish that it should be understood. This man was Cyrus, sometimes
called the Mukaukas, the evil genius of Egypt and of Alexandria. Cyrus
was made both Patriarch and Imperial Viceroy. He landed in 631, made no
attempt to conciliate or even to explain, persecuted the Copts, tried to
kill the Coptic Patriarch and at the end of ten year’s rule had ripened
Egypt for its fall. There was a Greek garrison in Alexandria and another
to the south of the present Cairo in a fort called “Babylon.” And there
were some other forces in the Delta and the fleet held the sea. But the
mass of the people were hostile. Heraclius ruled by violence, though he
did not realise it; the reports that Cyrus sent him never told the
truth. Indeed, he paid little attention to them; he was paralysed by a
new terror: Mohammedanism. His nerve failed him again, as at the Persian
invasion. Syria and the Holy Places were again lost to the Empire, this
time for ever. Broken in health and spirits, the Emperor slunk back to
Constantinople, and there, shortly before he died, Cyrus arrived with
the news that Egypt had been lost too.

What happened was this. The Arab general Amr had invaded Egypt with an
army of 4000 horse. Amr was not only a great general. He was an
administrator, a delightful companion, and a poet—one of the ablest and
most charming men that Islam ever produced. He would have been
remarkable in any age; he is all the more remarkable in an age that was
petrified by theology. Riding into Egypt by the coast where Port Said
stands now, he struck swiftly up the Nile, defeated an Imperial army at
Heliopolis and invested the fort of Babylon. Cyrus was inside it. His
character, like the Emperor’s, had collapsed. He knew that no native
Egyptian would resist the Arabs, and he may have felt, like many of his
contemporaries, that Christianity was doomed, that its complexities were
destined to perish before the simplicity of Islam. He negotiated a
peace, which the Emperor was to ratify. Heraclius was furious and
recalled him to Constantinople. But the mischief had been done; all
Egypt, with the exception of Alexandria, had been abandoned to the
heathen.

Alexandria was surely safe. In the first place the Arabs had no ships,
and Amr, for all his courage, was not the man to build one. “If a ship
lies still,” he writes, “it rends the heart; if it moves it terrifies
the imagination. Upon it a man’s power ever diminishes and calamity
increases. Those within it are like worms in a log, and if it rolls over
they are drowned.” Alexandria had nothing to fear on the seaward side
from such a foe and on the landward what could he do against her superb
walls, defended by all the appliances of military science? Amr, though
powerful, had no artillery. His was purely a cavalry force. And there
was no great alarm when, from the south east, the force was seen
approaching and encamping somewhere beyond the present Nouzha Gardens.
Moreover the Patriarch Cyrus was back, and had held a great service in
the Caesareum and exhorted the Christians to arms. Indeed it is not easy
to see why Alexandria did fall. There was no physical reason for it. One
is almost driven to say that she fell because she had no soul. Cyrus,
for the second time, betrayed his trust. He negotiated again with the
Arabs, as at Babylon, and signed (Nov. 8th, 641) an armistice with them,
during which the Imperial garrison evacuated the town. Amr did not make
hard terms; cruelty was neither congenial to him nor politic. Those
inhabitants who wished to leave might do so; the rest might worship as
they wished on payment of tribute.

The following year Amr entered in triumph through the Gate of the Sun
that closed the eastern end of the Canopic Way. Little had been ruined
so far. Colonnades of marble stretched before him, the Tomb of Alexander
rose to his left, the Pharos to his right. His sensitive and generous
soul may have been moved, but the message he sent to the Caliph in
Arabia is sufficiently prosaic. “I have taken,” he writes, “a city of
which I can only say that it contains 4,000 palaces, 4,000 baths, 400
theatres, 1,200 greengrocers and 40,000 Jews.” And the Caliph received
the news with equal calm, merely rewarding the messenger with a meal of
bread and oil and a few dates. There was nothing studied in this
indifference. The Arabs could not realise the value of their prize. They
knew that Allah had given them a large and strong city. They could not
know that there was no other like it in the world, that the science of
Greece had planned it, that it had been the intellectual birthplace of
Christianity. Legends of a dim Alexander, a dimmer Cleopatra, might move
in their minds, but they had not the historical sense, they could never
realise what had happened on this spot nor how inevitably the city of
the double harbour should have arisen between the lake and the sea. And
so though they had no intention of destroying her, they destroyed her,
as a child might a watch. She never functioned again for over 1,000
years.

One or two details are necessary, to complete this sketch of the
conquest. It had been a humane affair, and no damage had been done to
property; the library which the Arabs are usually accused of destroying
had already been destroyed by the Christians. A few years later,
however, some damage was done. Supported by an Imperial fleet, the city
revolted, and Amr was obliged to re-enter it by force. There was a
massacre, which he stayed by sheathing his sword; the Mosque of Amr or
of Mercy was built upon the site. As governor of Egypt, he administered
it well, but his interests lay inland not on the odious sea shore, and
he founded a city close to the fort of Babylon—Fostat, the germ of the
modern Cairo. Here all the life of the future was to centre. Here Amr
himself was to die. As he lay on his couch a friend said to him: “You
have often remarked that you would like to find an intelligent man at
the point of death, and to ask him what his feelings were. Now I ask you
that question.” Amr replied, “I feel as if the heaven lay close upon the
earth and I between the two, breathing through the eye of a needle.”
There is something in this dialogue that transports us into a new world;
it could never have taken place between two Alexandrians.

Such were the chief physical events in the city during the Christian
Period. We must now turn back to consider another and more important
aspect: the spiritual.

                                -------

                          THE SPIRITUAL CITY.




------------------------------------------------------------------------




                             INTRODUCTION.


When Cleopatra died and Egypt became part of the Roman Empire, it seemed
that the career of Alexandria was over. Her life had centred round the
Ptolemies who had adorned her with architecture and scholarship and
song, and when they were withdrawn what remained? She was just a
provincial capital. But the vitality of a city is not thus measured.
There is a splendour that kings do not give and cannot take away, and
just when she lost her outward independence she was recompensed by
discovering the kingdom that lies within. Three sections of her
citizens—Jews, Greeks and Christians—were attracted by the same
spiritual problem, and tried to solve it in the same way.

_The Problem._ It never occurred to these Alexandrian thinkers, as it
had to some of their predecessors in ancient Greece, that God might not
exist. They assumed that he existed. What troubled them was his relation
to the rest of the universe and particularly to Man. Was God close to
man? Or was he far away? If close, how could he be infinite and eternal
and omnipotent? And if far away, how could he take any interest in man,
why indeed should he have troubled to create him? They wanted God to be
both far and close.

_The Solution._ Savages solve such a problem by having two gods—a pocket
fetich whom they beat when he irritates them, and a remote spirit in the
sky, and they do not try to think out any connection between the two.
The Alexandrians, being cultivated, could not accept such crudities.
Instead, they assumed that between God and man there is an intermediate
being or beings, who draw the universe together, and ensure that though
God is far he shall also be close. They gave various names to this
intermediate being, and ascribed to him varying degrees of dignity and
power. But they became as certain of his existence as of God’s, for in
philosophy their temperament was mystic rather than scientific, and as
soon as they hit on an explanation of the universe that was comforting,
they did not stop to consider whether it might be true.

After this preliminary, let us approach the three great sections of
Alexandrian thought.




                              I. THE JEWS.

    THE SEPTUAGINT—about B.C. 200.
    THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON—about B.C. 100.
    PHILO—cont. with Christ.


The seat of the Jews was Jerusalem, where they had evolved their cult of
Jehovah and built him his unique temple. But as soon as Alexandria was
founded they began to emigrate to the lucrative and seductive city, and
to take up their quarters near the modern Ibrahimieh. Soon a generation
arose that was Greek in speech. The Hebrew Scriptures had to be
translated for their benefit, and seventy rabbis—so the legend goes—were
shut up by Ptolemy Philadelphus in seventy huts on the island of Pharos,
whence they simultaneously emerged with seventy identical translations
of the Bible. This was the famous Septuagint version—made as a matter of
fact over many years, and not completed till B.C. 130.

                  *       *       *       *       *

But the new generation was Greek in spirit as well as speech, and
diverged increasingly from the conservative Jews at Jerusalem. Both
sections worshipped Jehovah, but the Alexandrian grew more and more
conscious of the churlishness and inaccessibility of his national god.
Thought mingled with his adoration. How could he link Jehovah to man?
And, utilising a few hints in the orthodox scriptures, he produced as
his first attempt a fine piece of literature called “The Wisdom of
Solomon”; it is at present included in the Apocrypha. The author—his
name is unknown—not only wrote in Greek but had studied Stoic and
Epicurean Philosophy and Egyptian rites. He had the cosmopolitan culture
of Alexandria. And, solving his problem in the Alexandrian way, he
conceived an intermediate between Jehovah and man whom he calls Sophia
or Wisdom.

    Wisdom is more moving than any motion: she goeth through all things
    by reason of her pureness. Being but one she can do all things and
    in all ages entering into holy souls she makes them friends of God,
    and prophets. She is more beautiful than the sun and all the order
    of stars: being compared with the light she is found beyond it. For
    after this cometh night, but vice shall not prevail against wisdom.

In such a passage Wisdom is more than “being wise.” She is a messenger
who bridges the gulf and makes us friends of God.

                  *       *       *       *       *

In Philo the Jewish school of Alexandria reaches its height. Little is
known of his life. His brother was head of the Jewish community here and
he himself was sent (A.D. 40) on a disastrous embassy to the mad Emperor
Caligula at Rome.

Being an orthodox Jew, he states his philosophic problem in the language
of the Old Testament. Thus:—

Jehovah had said I AM THAT I AM—that is to say, nothing can be
predicated about God except existence. God has no qualities, no desires,
no form, and no home. We cannot even call God “God” because “God” is a
word, and no word can describe God. While to regard him as a man is to
commit “an error greater than the sea.” God IS, and no more can be said
of him.

Yet this unapproachable being has created us. How? And why?

Through his Logos or Word. This Logos of Philo is, like “Wisdom,” a
messenger who bridges the gulf. He is the outward expression of God’s
existence. He created and he sustains the world, and Philo uses the
actual language of devotion concerning him, calling him Israel the Seer,
the Dove, the Dweller in the Inmost,—language which naturally recalls
and possibly suggested the opening of St. John’s Gospel. “In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” Philo might have
written this. But he could not have written “the Word was God” nor “the
Word was made flesh” for it was, as we shall see, the distinction of
Christianity to conceive that the link between Man and God should be
himself both God and Man.

By this doctrine of the Logos, Philo made the Hebrew Jehovah
intelligible and acceptable to the Alexandrian Jews. It is a doctrine
not found in the Old Testament, and to extract it he had to employ
allegory and to wrest words from their natural meanings. This gives his
philosophy a frigid timid air, and obscures its real sublimity. Only
once or twice does he break loose, and declare that the path to truth
lies not through allegory but through vision. “Those who can see” he
exclaims, “lift their eyes to heavens, and contemplate the Manna, the
divine Logos. Those who cannot see, look at the onions in the ground.”
After his death, the Jews of Alexandria accomplished no more in
philosophy. They had stated the problem. The restatement was for the
Greeks and the Christians.


    JEWISH INSCRIPTIONS FROM IBRAHIMIEH: Museum, Room 21.




                           II. NEO-PLATONISM.

    PLOTINUS (204-262).
    PORPHYRY (233-306).
    HYPATIA (d. 415).


The Ptolemies had imported some Greek philosophers, as part of the
personnel of the Mouseion, but they were second-rate, and it was not
until the Ptolemies had passed away, and the city herself was declining,
that philosophy took root and bore the white mystic rose of
Neo-Platonism. It developed out of a doctrine of Plato’s. Six hundred
years before, Plato had taught at Athens that the world we live in is an
imperfect copy of an ideal world. He had also taught other things, but
this was the doctrine that the “New Platonists” of Alexandria took up
and pursued to sublime and mystic conclusions. Whatever Plato had
thought of this world as a philosopher, he had enjoyed it as a citizen
and a poet, and has left delightful accounts of it in his dialogues. The
Neo-Platonists were more logical. Since this world is imperfect, they
regarded it as negligible, and excluded from their writings all
references to daily life. They might be disembodied spirits, freed from
locality and time, and it is only after careful study that we realise
that they too were human,—nay, that they were typically Alexandrian, and
that in them the later city finds her highest expression.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The School was founded by Ammonius Saccas, who had begun life as a
porter in the docks, and as a Christian, but abandoned both professions
for the study of Plato. Nothing is known of his teaching, but he
produced great pupils—Longinus, Origen, and, greatest of all, Plotinus.
Plotinus was probably born at Assiout; probably; no one could find out
for certain because he was reticent about it, saying that the descent of
his soul into his body had been a great misfortune, which he did not
desire to discuss. He completed his main training at Alexandria, and
then took part in a military expedition against Persia, in order to get
into touch with Persian thought (Zoroastrianism), and with Indian
thought (Hinduism, Buddhism). He must have made a queer soldier and he
was certainly an unsuccessful one, for the expedition suffered defeat,
and Plotinus was very nearly relieved of the disgrace of having a body.
Escaping, he made his way to Rome, and remained there until the end of
his life, lecturing. In spite of his sincerity, he became fashionable,
and the psychic powers that he had acquired not only gained him, on four
occasions, the Mystic Vision which was the goal of his philosophy, but
also discovered a necklace which had been stolen from a rich lady by one
of her slaves. He was indifferent to literary composition; after his
death his pupil Porphyry collected his lecture-notes and published them
in nine volumes—the “Enneads.” The Enneads are ill arranged and often
obscure. But they contain a logical system of thought, some account of
which must be attempted—Alexandria produced nothing greater. And they
deal with the usual Alexandrian problem—the linking up of God and Man.

Like Philo, and like the Christians, Plotinus believes in God, and since
his God has three grades, we may almost say that he believes in a
Trinity. But it is very different to the Christian Trinity, and even
more difficult to understand. The first and highest grade in it he calls
the One. The One is—Unity, the One. Nothing else can be predicated about
it, not even that it exists; it is more incomprehensible than the
Jehovah of Philo; it has no qualities, no creative force, it is good
only as the goal of our aspirations. But though it cannot create, it
overflows (somewhat like a fountain), and from its overflow or emanation
is generated the second grade of the Trinity—the “Intellectual
Principle.” The Intellectual Principle is a little easier to understand
than the “One” because it has a remote connection with our lives. It is
the Universal mind that contains—not all things, but all thoughts of
things, and by thinking it creates. It thinks of the third grade—the All
Soul—which accordingly comes into being. With the All Soul we near the
realm of the comprehensible. It is the cause of the Universe that we
know. All that we grasp through the senses was created by it—the Gods of
Greece, etc. in the first place, then the demi-gods and demons, then,
descending in the scale, ourselves, then animals, plants, stones;
matter, that seems so important to us, is really the last and feeblest
emanation of the All Soul, the point at which creative power comes to a
halt.—And these three grades, the “One,” the “Intellectual Principle,”
and the “All Soul,” make up between them a single being, God; who is
three in one and one in three, and the goal of all creation.

Thus far the system of Plotinus may appear unattractive as well as
abstruse; we must now look at the other and more emotional side. Not
only do all things flow from God; they also strive to return to him; in
other words, the whole Universe has an inclination towards good. We are
all parts of God, even the stones, though we cannot realise it; and
man’s goal is to become actually, as he is potentially, divine.
Therefore rebirth is permitted, in order that we may realise God better
in a future existence than we can in this; and therefore the Mystic
Vision is permitted, in order that, even in this existence we may have a
glimpse of God. God is ourself, our true self, and in one of the few
literary passages in the Enneads, the style of Plotinus catches fire
from his thought and we are taught in words of immortal eloquence, how
the Vision may be obtained.

    But what must we do? How lies the path? How come to vision of the
    inaccessible Beauty, dwelling as if in consecrated precincts, apart
    from the common ways where all men may see?

    “Let us flee to the beloved Fatherland.” This is the soundest
    counsel. But what is the flight? How are we to gain the open sea?

    The Fatherland is There whence we have come, and There is the
    Father.

    What then is our course, what the manner of our flight? This is not
    a journey for the feet; the feet bring us only from land to land;
    all this order of things you must set aside and refuse to see; you
    must close the eyes and call instead upon another vision which is to
    be waked within you, a vision the birth-right of all, which few can
    see....

    Withdraw into yourself and look. And if you do not find yourself
    beautiful yet, act as does the creator of a statue that is to be
    made beautiful; he cuts away here, he smooths there, he makes this
    line lighter, that purer, until a lovely face has grown upon his
    work.

    When you know that you have become this perfect work, when you are
    self-gathered in the purity of your being, nothing now remaining
    that can shatter that inner unity—when you perceive that you have
    grown to this, you are now become very vision; now call up all your
    confidence, strike forward yet a step—you need a guide no
    longer—forward yet a step—you need a guide no longer—strain and see.

    This is the only eye that sees the mighty Beauty. If the eye that
    ventures the vision be dimmed by vice, impure or weak, then it sees
    nothing even though another point to what lies plain before it. To
    any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what is to be seen, and
    having some resemblance to it. Never did eye see the sun unless it
    had first become sunlike, and never can the soul have vision of the
    first Beauty unless itself be beautiful.[4]

Footnote 4:

  S. McKenna’s Translation.

This sublime passage suggests three comments, with which our glance at
Plotinus must close. In the first place its tone is religious, and in
this it is typical of all Alexandrian philosophy. In the second place it
lays stress on behaviour and training; the Supreme Vision cannot be
acquired by magic tricks—only those will see it who are fit to see. And
in the third place the vision of oneself and the vision of God are
really the same, because each individual is God, if only he knew it. And
here is the great difference between Plotinus and Christianity. The
Christian promise is that a man shall see God, the Neo-Platonic—like the
Indian—that he shall be God. Perhaps, on the quays of Alexandria,
Plotinus talked with Hindu merchants who came to the town. At all events
his system can be paralleled in the religious writings of India. He
comes nearer than any other Greek philosopher to the thought of the
East.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Porphyry, the pious disciple of Plotinus, was himself a philosopher of
note, and the Neo-Platonic School continued to flourish all through the
4th cent. Its main temper kept the same; it was pessimistic as regards
the actual world and actual men, but optimistic as regards the future
because it believed that the world and all in it has emanated from God
and has been granted the means of reverting to him. It recognised the
presence of Evil but not its eternal existence, and consequently it was
a practical support to its believers, and upheld the last of them,
Hypatia, through martyrdom.

    When I do contemplate your words and you
    revered Hypatia, then I kneel to view
    the Virgin’s starry home; there in the skies
    your works and perfect words I recognise,
    a star unsullied of instruction wise.[5]

Footnote 5:

  Translated by R. A. Furness.

Thus wrote an unknown admirer at the beginning of the 5th Century. None
of Hypatia’s discourses have been preserved, but we know that with her
and with her father, Theon, the great tradition of Plotinus expired at
Alexandria.




                           III. CHRISTIANITY.


                             INTRODUCTION.


Percolating through the Jewish Communities, the Christian religion
reached Egypt as early as the 1st cent. A.D. On its arrival, it found,
already established there, two distinct forms of spiritual life.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The first was the spiritual life of Ancient Egypt, which had clung to
the soil of the Nile valley for over 4,000 years. It had existed so long
that though Christianity could close its temples she never quite
uprooted it from the heart of the people. The resurrection of Osiris as
Sun God; the partaking of him as Corn God by the blessed in the world
below; the beneficent group of the mother Isis with Horus her child; the
same Horus as a young warrior slaying the snaky Set; the key-shaped
“ankh” that the gods and goddesses carried as a sign of their
immortality:—these symbols had sunk too deeply into the minds of the
native Egyptians to be removed by episcopal decrees. Consequently there
were cases of reversion—e.g. at Menouthis (near Aboukir) in 480, when
some villagers were discovered worshipping the ancient deities in a
private house. And there were also cases of confusion, where the old
religion passed imperceptibly into the new. Did Christianity borrow from
the Osiris cult her doctrines of the Resurrection and Personal
Immortality, and her sacrament of the Eucharist? The suggestion has been
made. It is more certain that she borrowed much of her symbolism and
popular art. Isis and Horus become the Virgin and Child, Horus and Set
St. George and the Dragon, while the “ankh” appears unaltered on some of
the Christian tomb stones as a looped cross, and slightly altered on
others as a cross with a handle.

The second form of spiritual life was the life of Alexandria. Its
quality (mainly Hellenic and philosophic) has already been indicated.
Christianity, to begin with, was not philosophic, being addressed to
poor and unfashionable people in Palestine. But as soon as it reached
Alexandria its character altered, the turning point in its worldly
career arrived. The Alexandrians were highly cultivated, they had
libraries where all the wisdom of the Mediterranean was accessible, and
their faith inevitably took a philosophic form. Occupied by their
favourite problem of the relation between God and Man, they at once
asked the same question of the new religion as they asked the Jews and
the Greeks—namely, What is the link? Philo said the Logos, Plotinus the
Emanations. The new religion replied “Christ.” There was nothing
startling to the Alexandrians in such a reply. Christ too was the Word,
he too proceeded from the Father. His incarnation, his redemption of
mankind through suffering—even these were not strange ideas to people
who were accustomed to “divine” kings, and familiar with the myths of
Prometheus and Adonis. Alexandrian orthodoxy, Alexandrian heresies, both
centred round the problem that was familiar to Alexandrian paganism—the
relation between God and Man.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Thus Christianity did not burst upon Egypt or upon Alexandria like a
clap of thunder, but stole into ears already prepared. Neither on her
popular nor on her philosophic side was she a creed apart. Only
politically did she stand out as an innovator, through her denial of
divinity to the Imperial Government at Rome.

                 (I). GNOSTICISM (Esoteric knowledge).


    CERINTHUS—About 100 A.D.
    BASILIDES—120.
    VALENTINUS—140.

Gnosticism taught that the world and mankind are the result of an
unfortunate blunder. God neither created us nor wished us to be created.
We are the work of an inferior deity, the Demiurge, who wrongly believes
himself God, and we are doomed to decay. But God, though not responsible
for our existence, took pity on it, and has sent his Christ to
counteract the ignorance of the Demiurge and to give us Gnosis
(knowledge). Christ is the link between the divine and that unfortunate
mistake the human.

The individual Gnostics played round this idea. Cerinthus (educated
here) taught that Jesus was a man, and Christ a spirit who left him at
death. Basilides (a Syrian visitor) that there were three dispensations,
pre-Jewish, Jewish, and Christian, each of whose rulers had a son, which
son comprehended more of God than did his father. The Ophites worshipped
snakes because the serpent in Eden was really a messenger from God, who
induced Eve to disobey the Demiurge Jehovah. Consequently if we wish to
be good we must be bad—a conclusion that was also reached, though by a
different route, by Carpocrates, who organised an Abode of Love on one
of the Greek islands. These are unsavoury charlatans. But one of the
Gnostics—Valentinus—was a man of another stamp, and his system has a
tragic quality most rare in Alexandria.

Valentinus (probably an Egyptian; educated here; taught mainly at Rome)
held the usual Gnostic doctrine that creation is a mistake. But he tried
to explain how the mistake came about. He imagines a primal God, the
centre of a divine harmony, who sent out manifestations of himself in
pairs of male and female. Each pair was inferior to its predecessor, and
Sophia (“wisdom”) the female of the thirtieth pair, least perfect of
all. She showed her imperfection not, like Lucifer, by rebelling from
God, but by desiring too ardently to be united to him. She fell through
love. Hurled from the divine harmony, she fell into matter, and the
universe is formed out of her agony and remorse. She herself was rescued
by the first Christ but not before she had born a son, the Demiurge, who
rules this world of sadness and confusion, and is incapable of realising
anything beyond it. In this world there are three classes of men, all
outwardly the same, men of the Body, the Spirit, and the Soul. The first
two belong to the Demiurge and ought to obey him. The third are really
the elect of his mother Sophia. He rules them but cannot make them obey.
It was for their salvation that the Christ whom we call Jesus descended
straight from the primal God and left with his twelve disciples the
secret tradition of the Gnosis.

With Valentinus the Gnosticism of Alexandria reaches its height. Further
east it took other forms. It had spread by 150 A.D. all round the
Mediterranean, and threatened to defeat orthodox Christianity. But it
was pessimistic, imaginative, esoteric—three great obstacles to success.
It was not a creed any society could adopt, being anti-social, and by
the time of Constantine its vogue was over.

    GNOSTIC AMULETS: Museum, Room 17.


                       (II). ORTHODOXY. (Early).




    CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA—about 200.
    ORIGEN—185-253.

Orthodoxy at Alexandria did not begin on clear cut lines; indeed the
more we look at it the more it melts into its surroundings. It adapted
from Philo his doctrine of the Logos, and identified the Logos with
Christ. It shared with Gnosticism the desire for knowledge of God, while
declaring that such knowledge need not be esoteric. It has its special
Gospel—St. Mark’s—but other Gospels, since condemned as uncanonical,
were equally read in its churches, e.g. the Gospels of the Hebrews and
of the Egyptians. It was permeated by Greek thought—Neo-Platonists
became Christians, and _vice versa_. But one distinguishing doctrine it
did have—the supreme value of Christ. Christ was the “Word” incarnate,
through whom the love and power of God could alone be “known.” Problems
as to Christ’s nature did not trouble the earlier theologians. Their
impulse was to testify, not to analyse. A feeling of joy inspires their
interminable writings, and it is possible to detect through their
circumlocution the faith that steeled the martyrs, their contemporaries.

Clement of Alexandria (probably a Greek from Athens) was head of the big
theological college here. His problem, like that of the Jews before him,
was to recommend his religion to a subtle and philosophic city, and his
methods forestall those of the advanced missionary to-day. He does not
denounce Greek philosophy. His line is that it is a preparation for the
Gospel, that the Jewish law was also a preparation, and that all that
happened before the birth of Christ is indeed a divine approach to that
supreme event. Learned and enlightened, he set Christianity upon a path
that she did not long consent to follow. He raised her from intellectual
obscurity, he lent her for a little Hellenic persuasion, and the
graciousness of Greece seems in his pages not incompatible with the
Grace of God.

    He is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven who shall do and teach
    in imitation of God by showing free Grace like His; for the bounties
    of God are for the common benefits.

Only in Alexandria could such a theologian have arisen.

His work was carried on by his pupil Origen, the strangest and most
adventurous of the Early Fathers. Gentle and scholarly by nature, Origen
had an instinct for self-immolation that troubled his life and the lives
of his friends. He was an Egyptian (the name is connected with Horus),
and he was born here of Christian parents and tried as a boy to share
his father’s martyrdom at the Temple of Serapis. Calmed for a while, he
supported his mother and brothers, and was fellow pupil with Plotinus.
Then he became head of the Theological College, and having attained fame
as a teacher and lay preacher, castrated himself (a “Eunuch for the
Kingdom of Heaven’s sake.”—Matt. xix, 12). His patron, the Bishop of
Alexandria, disowned him for this, and ruled that he could not now take
orders; other bishops declared that he could, and the Christian
communities were divided by the grotesque controversy. Origen was
considerate and even repentant; he had no wish to cause scandal, and
when ordered to leave Alexandria he obeyed. But his opinions ever verged
towards the incorrect; he believed, like Plotinus, in pre-existence, he
disbelieved in the eternity of punishment, and it is with the greatest
hesitation that orthodoxy has received him to her bosom. In the main he
developed the theory of his master Clement—that Christianity is the heir
of the past and the interpreter of the future,—and he taught that Christ
has been with mankind not only at his incarnation but since the
beginning of creation, and has in all ages linked them, according to
their capacity, with God.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Thus the characteristic of early orthodoxy was a belief in Christ as the
link between God and Man. A humanising belief; the work of the Greek
scholars who had subtilised and universalised the simpler faith of
Palestine, and had imparted into it doctrines taught by Paganism. We
must now watch it harden and transform. Several causes transformed
it—e.g. the growth of an ignorant monasticism in Egypt, the growth in
Northern Africa, of a gloomier type of Christianity under Tertullian,
and the general spirit of aggression the new religion everywhere
displayed as soon as Constantine labelled it as official. But there was
one cause that was inherent in the belief itself, and that alone
concerns us here. Christ was the Son of God. All agreed. But what was
the _Nature_ of Christ? The subtle Alexandrian intellect asked this
question about the year 300, and the Arian heresy was the result. It
asked it again about 400 and produced the Monophysite heresy. And a
third query about 600 produced a third heresy, the Monothelite. Let us
glance at these three in turn. Heresies to others, they were of course
orthodox in their own eyes. Each believed itself the only interpreter of
the link that binds God to Man.

    UNCANONICAL GOSPELS: Appendix p. 217.


                            (III). ARIANISM.


Christ is the Son of God. Then is he not younger than God? Arius held
that he was and that there was a period before time began when the First
Person of the Trinity existed and the Second did not. A typical
Alexandrian theologian, occupied with the favourite problem of linking
human and divine, Arius thought to solve the problem by making the link
predominately human. He did not deny the Godhead of Christ, but he did
make him inferior to the Father—of _like_ substance, not of the _same_
substance, which was the view held by Athanasius, and stamped as
orthodox by the Council of Nicaea. Moreover the Arian Christ, like the
Gnostic Demiurge, made the world;—creation, an inferior activity, being
entrusted to him by the Father, who had Himself created nothing but
Christ.

It is easy to see why Arianism became popular. By making Christ younger
and lower than God it brought him nearer to us—indeed it tended to level
him into a mere good man and to forestall Unitarianism. It appealed to
the untheologically minded, to emperors and even more to empresses. But
St. Athanasius, who viewed the innovation with an expert eye, saw that
while it popularised Christ it isolated God, and he fought it with
vigour and venom. His success has been described (p. 47). It was
condemned as heretical in 325, and by the end of the century had been
expelled from orthodox Christendom. Of the theatre of this ancient
strife no trace remains at Alexandria; the church of St. Mark where
Arius was presbyter has vanished: so have the churches where Athanasius
thundered—St. Theonas and the Caesareum. Nor do we know in which street
Arius died of epilepsy. But the strife still continues in the hearts of
men, who always tend to magnify the human in the divine, and it is
probable that many an individual Christian to-day is an Arian without
knowing it.

    PICTURE OF COUNCIL OF NICAEA: p. 106.


                 (IV). MONOPHYSISM. (“Single Nature.”)


Christ is the Son of God, but also the Son of Mary. Then has he two
natures or one? The Monophysites said “one.” They did not deny Christ’s
incarnation, but they asserted that the divine in him had quite absorbed
the human. The question was first raised in clerical circles in
Constantinople, but Alexandria took it up hotly, and “Single Nature”
became the national cry of Egypt. We have already seen (p. 51) the
political importance of this heresy, how it was connected with a racial
movement against the Greeks, how when it was condemned at Chalcedon
(451) Egypt slipped into permanent mutiny against the Empire. The
Council announced that Christ had two natures, unmixed and unchangeable
but at the same time indistinguishable and inseparable. This is the
orthodox view—the one we hold. The Copts (and Abyssinians) are still
Monophysites, and consequently not in communion with the rest of
Christendom.

    COPTIC CHURCH: p. 160, 212.


                   (V). MONOTHELISM. (“Single Will.”)


As the minds of the Alexandrians decayed, their heresies became more and
more technical. Arianism enshrines a real problem which the layman as
well as the cleric can apprehend. Monophysism is more remote. And
Monothelism is difficult to state in the language of theology, and
almost impossible to state in the language of common sense. Perhaps it
bears in it the signs of carelessness, for as we have seen (p. 54) it
was the invention of the Emperor Heraclius in the last desperate days
when he was trying to conciliate Egypt.

If Christ has one Nature he has of course one will. But suppose he has
two Natures. How many wills has he then? The Monothelites said “One.”
The orthodox view—the one we hold—is “Two, one human the other divine,
but both operating in unison.” Obscure indeed is the problem, and we can
well believe that the Alexandrians, against whom the Arabs were then
marching, did not understand Monothelism when it was hurriedly explained
to them by a preoccupied general. But it was not without a future. It
failed as a compromise but survived as a heresy, and long after the
Imperial Government had disowned it and Egypt had fallen to Islam, it
was cherished in the uplands of Syria by the Maronite Church.

    MARONITE CHURCH: p. 140, 213.


                           CONCLUSION: ISLAM.


We have now seen Alexandria handle one after another the systems that
entered her walls. The ancient religion of the Hebrews, the philosophy
of Plato, the new faith out of Galilee—taking each in turn she has left
her impress upon it, and extracted some answer to her question, “How can
the human be linked to the divine?”

It may be argued that this question must be asked by all who have the
religious sense, and that there is nothing specifically Alexandrian
about it. But no; it need not be asked; it was never asked by Islam, by
the faith that swept the city physically and spiritually into the sea.
“There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the Prophet of God” says
Islam, proclaiming the needlessness of a mediator; the man Mohammed has
been chosen to tell us what God is like and what he wishes, and there
all machinery ends, leaving us to face our Creator. We face him as a God
of power, who may temper his justice with mercy, but who does not stoop
to the weakness of Love, and we are well content that, being powerful,
he shall be far away. That old dilemma, that God ought at the same time
to be far away and close at hand, cannot occur to an orthodox
Mohammedan. It occurs to those who require God to be loving as well as
powerful, to Christianity and to its kindred growths, and it is the
weakness and the strength of Alexandria to have solved it by the
conception of a link. Her weakness: because she had always to be
shifting the link up and down—if she got it too near God it was too far
from Man, and _vice versa_. Her strength: because she did cling to the
idea of Love, and much philosophic absurdity, much theological aridity,
must be pardoned to those who maintain that the best thing on earth is
likely to be the best in heaven.

Islam, strong through its abjuration of Love, was the one system that
the city could not handle. It gave no opening to her manipulations. Her
logoi, her emanations and aeons, her various Christs, orthodox, Arian,
Monophysite, or Monothelite—it threw them all down as unnecessary lumber
that do but distract the true believer from his God. The physical decay
that crept on her in the 7th century had its counterpart in a spiritual
decay. Amr and his Arabs were not fanatics or barbarians and they were
about to start near Cairo a new Egypt of their own. But they
instinctively shrank from Alexandria; she seemed to them idolatrous and
foolish; and a thousand years of silence succeeded them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                    THE ARAB TOWN (7th-16th Cents.)


During the thousand years and more that intervene between the Arab
conquest of Egypt and its conquest by Napoleon, the events in the
history of Alexandria are geographic rather than political. Neglected by
man, the land and the waters altered their positions, and could
Alexander the Great have returned he would have failed to recognise the
coast. (i) The fundamental change was in the 12th cent., when the
Canopic mouth of the Nile silted up. Consequently the fresh water lake
of Mariout, being no longer fed by the Nile floods, also silted and
ceased to be navigable. Alexandria was cut off from the entire river
system of Egypt, and could not flourish until it was restored; she has
always required the double nourishment of fresh water and salt. (ii)
There was also a change in the outline of the city: the dyke
Heptastadion, built by the Ptolemies to connect the mainland with the
island of Pharos, fell into ruin and became a backbone along which a
broad spit of land accreted; and so Pharos turned from an island into a
peninsula—the present Ras-el-Tin.

The Arabs, though they let the city fall out of repair, admired it
greatly. One of them writes as follows:—

    The city was all white and bright by night as well as by day. By
    reason of the walls and pavements of white marble the people used to
    wear black garments; it was the glare of the marble that made the
    monks wear black. So too it was painful to go out by night ... a
    tailor could see to thread his needle without a lamp. No one entered
    without a covering over his eyes.

A second writer describes the green silk awnings that were spread over
the Canopic Way. A third, even more enthusiastic exclaims:—

    I have made the Pilgrimage to Mecca sixty times, but if Allah had
    suffered me to stay a month at Alexandria and pray on its shores,
    that month would be dearer to me.

The Arabs were anything but barbarians; their own great city of Cairo is
a sufficient answer to that charge. But their civilisation was Oriental
and of the land; it was out of touch with the Mediterranean civilisation
that has evolved Alexandria. At first they made some effort to adapt it
to their needs. The church of St. Theonas became part of the huge
“Mosque of the 1,000 Columns;” the church of St. Athanasius also became
a Mosque—the present Attarine Mosque occupies part of its site; and a
third Mosque, that of the Prophet Daniel, rose on the Mausoleum of
Alexander. But the Caesareum, the Mouseion, the Pharos, the Ptolemaic
Palace, all became ruinous. So did the walls. And though the Arabs built
new walls in 811, their course is so short that they vividly illustrate
the decline of the town and of the population. (See map p. 98). They
only enclosed a fragment of the ancient city.

In 828 the Venetians, according to their own account, stole from
Alexandria the body of St. Mark, concealing it first in a tub of pickled
pork in order to repel the attentions of the Moslem officials on the
quay. The theft was a pardonable one, for the Arabs never seem to know
that it had been made; it occasioned much satisfaction in Venice and no
inconvenience in Alexandria. St. Mark procured, there was little to
attract the European world; the ports of Egypt were now Rosetta
(Bolbitiné Mouth of the Nile), and Damietta (Phatnitic Mouth); there was
no reason to approach Alexandria now that her water system had
collapsed. Towards the end of the Arab rule she did indeed regain some
slight importance; the Mameluke Sultan of Cairo, Kait Bey, built on the
ruins of the Pharos the fine fort that bears his name (1480). He built
it as a defence against the growing naval power of the Turks. The Turks
conquered Egypt in 1517, and a new but equally unimportant chapter in
the history of Alexandria begins.

                  THE TURKISH TOWN (16th-18th Cents.)


Under the Turks the population continued to shrink, so that eventually
the narrow enclosure of the Arab walls became too large. A new
settlement sprang up on the neck of land that had formed between the two
harbours. It still exists and is known as the “Turkish Town.” A
second-rate affair; little more than a strip of houses intermixed with
small mosques; a meagre copy of Rosetta, where the architecture of these
centuries can best be studied. So unimportant a place can have no
connected history. All that one can do is to quote the isolated comments
of a few travelers. (i) The English sailor, John Foxe, (1577) has a
lively tale to tell. He had been caught by the Turkish corsairs and
imprisoned with his mates. With the connivance of a friendly Spaniard he
organised a mutiny, recaptured his ship and in true British style worked
it out of the Eastern Harbour under the fire of the guns on Kait Bey.
(ii) John Sandys (1610) gives a quaint but impressive description of the
decay:—

    Such was this Queen of Cities and Metropolis of Africa: who now hath
    nothing left her but ruins; and those ill witnesses of his perished
    beauties: declaring rather that towns as well as men have the ages
    and destinies.... Sundry Mountains were raised of the ruins, by
    Christians not to be mounted; lest they should take too exact a
    survey of the city: in which are often found, (especially after a
    shower) rich stones and medals engraven with the figure of their
    Gods and men with such perfection of Art as these now cut seeme lame
    to those and unlively counterfeits.

(iii). Captain Norden, a Dane, (1757) was in an irritable mood, as the
Turks would not let him sketch the fortifications. The English community
was already in existence, and the Captain’s account of it makes
interesting if painful reading:—

    They keep themselves quiet and conduct themselves without making
    much noise. If any nice affair is to be undertaken they withdraw
    themselves from it and leave to the French the honour of removing
    all difficulties. When any benefits result from it they have their
    share and if affairs turn out ill they secure themselves in the best
    manner they can.


[Illustration: Extrait des _Observations de plvsieurs singvlaritez etc._
par Pierre Belon du Mans Paris 1554]


(iv). Another irritable visitor landed here in 1779—the lively but
spiteful Mrs. Eliza Fay. Being a Christian, she was not allowed to
disembark in the Western Harbour nor to ride any animal nobler than a
donkey. She visited Cleopatra’s Needles and Pompey’s Pillar, then writes
to her sister “I certainly deem myself very fortunate in quitting this
place so soon.” She makes no mention of the English community, but was
entertained by the Prussian Consul, and has left an unflattering account
of his stout wife.

There are some old maps, compiled from the accounts of travellers, but
bearing little reference to reality. That of Pierre Belon (1554) is
reproduced on p. 83. Its main errors are the introduction of the Nile,
and the outflow of Lake Mariout to the sea. It shows the two harbours,
the Arab walls, Cleopatra’s Needles, Pompey’s Pillar and the Canopic or
Rosetta Gate (Porte du Caire). The Turkish town has not yet been built.
De Monconys’ map of 1665—_see_ frontispiece—is in some ways still more
absurd; Cleopatra’s Needle has turned into a pyramid. The mound in the
right centre is meant for Fort Cafarelli. The beginnings of the Turkish
Town appear on Ras-el-Tin. In 1743 Richard Pocock published the first
scientific map in his “Description of the East;” measurements and
soundings are given. Captain Norden the Dane brought out a good
pictorial plan of the “New,” i.e. Eastern harbour, showing the seamarks.
And the exact extent of Alexandria’s decay is shown in the magnificent
map published by the French expedition under Napoleon. There we see that
the Arab enclosure is empty except for a few houses on Kom-el-Dik and by
the Rosetta Gate, and that the population—only 4,000—is huddled into the
wall-less Turkish Town.

With Napoleon a new age begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------




                         NAPOLEON (1798-1801).


On July 1st 1798 the inhabitants of the obscure town saw that the
deserted sea was covered with an immense fleet. Three hundred sailing
ships came out from the west to anchor off Marabout Island, men
disembarked all night and by the middle of next day 5,000 French
soldiers under Napoleon had occupied the place. They were part of a
larger force, and had come under the pretence of helping Turkey, against
whom Egypt was then having one of her feeble and periodic revolts. The
future Emperor was still a mere general of the French Republic, but
already an influence on politics, and this expedition was his own plan.
He was in love with the East just then. The romance of the Nile valley
had touched his imagination, and he knew that it was the road to an even
greater romance—India. At war with England, he saw himself gaining at
England’s expense an Oriental realm and reviving the power of Alexander
the Great. In him, as in Mark Antony, Alexandria nourished imperial
dreams. The expedition failed but its memory remained with him: he had
touched the East, the nursery of kings.

Leaving Alexandria at once, he marched on Cairo and won the battle of
the Pyramids. Then an irreparable disaster befel him. He had left his
admiral, Brueys, with instructions to dispose the fleet as safely as
possible, since Nelson was known to be in pursuit. Under modern
conditions Brueys would have sailed into the Western Harbour, but in
1798 the reefs that cross the entrance had not been blasted away, and
though the transports got in the passages were rather dangerous for the
big men-of-war. Brueys was nervous and thought he had better take them
round to an anchorage, supposed impeccable, in the Bay of Aboukir.
Nelson followed him, attacked him unexpectedly and destroyed his fleet.
Details of this famous engagement, the so-called “Battle of the Nile,”
are given in another place (p. 177); its result was to lose for Napoleon
the command of the sea. The French expedition took Cairo and remained
powerful on land, but could receive no reinforcements, no messages, and
withered away like a plant that has been cut at the root. Turkey
declared against it, and a Turkish force, supported by British ships,
landed at Aboukir (July 1799). Here Napoleon was successful. He
commanded in person and in a series of brilliant engagements drove the
invaders into the sea: this is the “Land” battle of Aboukir (described
in detail p. 179). But his dreams had been shattered by Nelson. He saw
that his destiny, whatever it was, would not be accomplished in the
East, and meanly deserting his army he slipped back to France.

                  *       *       *       *       *

We now come to the first British expedition, and to its successful and
interesting campaign. In March 1801 Sir Ralph Abercrombie landed with
1,500 men at Aboukir. His aim was not to occupy Egypt, but to induce the
French armies to evacuate it. He marched westward against Alexandria,
keeping close to the sea. The country on his left was very different to
what it is now, and to understand his operations two of the differences
must be remembered. (i) The “Lake of Aboukir,” since drained, stretched
from Aboukir Bay almost as far as Ramleh. As it connected with the sea,
it was full of salt water. (ii) The present Lake Mariout was almost dry.
It contained a little fresh water, but most of its enormous bed was
under cultivation. It lay twelve feet below the waters of Lake Aboukir,
and was protected from them by a dyke. Thus Abercrombie saw water where
we see land, and _vice versa_. He advanced with success as far as
Mandourah, because his left flank was protected by Lake Aboukir. But
when he wanted to attack the French position at Ramleh he feared they
would outflank him over the dry bed of Mariout. His losses had been
heavy, his advance was held up; wounded in the thigh by a musket shot,
he had to abandon the command, and was carried on to a boat where he
died; a small monument at Sidi Gaber commemorates him to-day. His
successor, Hutchinson, took drastic measures. At the advice of his
engineers he cut the dyke that separated Lake Aboukir from Mariout. The
salt water rushed in, to the delight of the British soldiers, and in a
month thousands of acres had been drowned, Alexandria was isolated from
the rest of Egypt, and the left flank of the expedition was protected
all the way up to the walls of the town. Later in the year a second
British force landed to the west of Alexandria, at Marabout, and, caught
between two fires, the French were obliged to surrender. They were given
easy terms, and allowed to leave Egypt with all the honours of war. The
British followed them; we had accomplished our aim, and had no reason to
remain in the country any longer; we left it to our allies the Turks.
But the sleep of so many centuries had been broken. The eyes of Europe
were again directed to the deserved shore. Though Napoleon had failed
and the British had retired, a new age had begun for Alexandria. Life
flowed back into her, just as the waters, when Hutchinson cut the dyke,
flowed back into Lake Mariout.

                       MOHAMMED ALI (1805-1848).


When Napoleon drove the Turks into the sea at Aboukir, among the
fugitives was Mohammed Ali, the founder of the present reigning house of
Egypt. Little is known of his origin. He was an Albanian, but born at
Cavala in Macedonia where he is said to have distinguished himself as a
tax collector in his earlier youth. His education was primitive; he was
ignorant of history and economics and only learnt the Arabic alphabet
late in life. But he was a man of great ability and power and an acute
judge of character. He reappears in Egypt in 1801, still obscure, and
fights under Abercrombie. When the English withdrew he profited by the
internal disturbances and became in 1805 Viceroy of the country under
the Sultan of Turkey.

His power was consolidated by the disastrous British expedition of
1807—General Frazer’s “reconnoitering” expedition, as it is officially
termed. England was hostile to Turkey now, and Frazer was sent to see
whether a diversion could be created in Egypt. He landed, like Napoleon
before him, at Marabout, but with no more than the following
regiments;—the 31st, the 35th, the 78th, and a foreign legion: 4,000 men
in all. He occupied Alexandria and Rosetta, but before long Mohammed Ali
had killed or captured half his force and he was obliged to ask for
terms. They were readily granted. The “reconnoitering” expedition was
allowed to reembark, and the only trace it has left of its presence in
Alexandria is a tombstone of a soldier of the 78th, in the courtyard of
the Greek Patriarchate.

For thirty years the power of Mohammed Ali grew, and with it the
importance of Alexandria, his virtual capital. He freed the Holy Places
of Arabia from a heretical sect, he interfered in Greece, he revolted
against his suzerain the Sultan of Turkey, and invading Syria added it
to his dominions. A kingdom, comparable in extent to the Ptolemaic, had
come into existence with Alexandria as its centre, and it seemed that
the dreams of Napoleon would be realised by this Albanian adventurer,
and that the English would be cut off from India. England took alarm.
And suddenly the empire of Mohammed Ali fell. Syria revolted (1840),
supported by a British fleet, and soon the English admiral, Sir Charles
Napier, was at Alexandria, and compelled the Viceroy to confine himself
to Egypt. According to tradition the interview took place in the new
Ras-el-Tin Palace, and Napier exclaims “If Your Highness will not listen
to my unofficial appeal to you against the folly of further resistance,
it only remains for me to bombard you, and by God I will bombard you and
plant my bombs in the middle of this room where you are sitting.” Anyhow
Mohammed Ali gave in. He had failed as a European power, but he had
secured for his family a comfortable principality in Egypt, where he was
king in all but name.

His internal policy was rather disreputable. He admired European
civilization because it made people aggressive and gave them guns, but
he had no sense of its finer aspects, and his “reforms” were mainly
veneer to impress travellers. He exploited the fellahin by buying grain
from them at his own price: the whole of Egypt became his private farm.
Hence the importance of the foreign communities at Alexandria at this
date: he needed their aid to dispose of the produce in European markets.
He won over the British and other consuls to be his agents by giving
them licences to export Egyptian antiquities, which were then coming
into fashion; our own Consul Henry Salt—his tomb is here—was a
particular offender in this. He also gave away “Cleopatra’s Needles” to
the British and American Governments respectively; the obelisks that
still remained on their original sites outside the vanished Caesareum,
and would have lent such dignity to our modern sea front. Still, with
all his faults, he did create the modern city, such as she is. He waved
his wand, and what we see arose from the aged soil. Let us examine it
for a moment.

                            THE MODERN CITY.


During the years 1798-1807 as many as four expeditions had landed at or
near Alexandria—one French, one Turkish, and two English. Egypt had
again been drawn into the European system. A maritime capital was
necessary, and the genius of Mohammed Ali realised that it could be
found not in the mediaeval ports of Damietta and Rosetta, but in a
restored Alexandria. The city that we know to-day has followed the lines
that he laid down, and it is interesting to compare his dispositions
with those of Alexander the Great, over two thousand years before.

The main problem was the waters. The English, by cutting the dykes in
1801, had refilled Lake Mariout so that it had suddenly regained its
ancient area. But it was too shallow for navigation and they had filled
it with salt water instead of the former fresh: it gave no access to the
system of the Nile. That system had to be tapped. Alexander could find
the Nile at Aboukir (Canopic Mouth): now it was as far off as Rosetta
(ancient Bolbitic Mouth). Consequently Mohammed Ali had to construct a
canal 45 miles long. This canal, called the Mahmoudieh after Mahmoud,
the reigning Sultan of Turkey, was completed in 1820. It was badly made
and the sides were always falling in, but it led to the immediate rise
of Alexandria and to the decay of Rosetta. Alexandria now had water
communications with Cairo, to which was added communication by rail. The
Harbour followed. Mohammed Ali developed the Western which had been the
less important in classical times. The present docks and arsenals were
built for him (1828-1833) by the French engineer De Cerisy. A fleet was
added. To the same scheme belongs the impressive Ras-el-Tin Palace,
which standing on a rise above the harbour dominated it as the Ptolemaic
Palace had once dominated the Eastern; the favourite residence of the
Viceroy, it indicated that his new kingdom was no mere oriental
monarchy, but a modern power with its face to the sea.

Meanwhile the town started its development, but not on very regal lines.
Houses began to run up and streets to sprawl over the deserted area
inside the Arab Walls. It did not occur either to Mohammed Ali or to his
friends the Foreign Communities that a city ought to be planned. Their
one achievement was a Square and certainly quite a fine one—the Place
des Consuls, now Place Mohammed Ali. The English were granted land to
the north of the Square, on part of which they built their church, the
French and the Greeks land to the south; areas were also acquired by
other communities, e.g. by the Armenians. But there was no attempt to
coordinate the various enterprises, or to utilise the existing features
of the site. These features were: the sea, the lake, Pompey’s Pillar,
the forts of Kom-el-Dik and Cafarelli, and the Arab Walls. The sea was
ignored except for commercial purposes; the main thoroughfares still
keep away from its shores, and even the fine New Quays are attracting no
buildings to their curve. The lake was ignored even more completely—the
lake whose delicate pale expanse might so have beautified the southern
quarters; many people do not know that a lake exists. Pompey’s Pillar,
instead of being the centre of converging roads, has been left where it
will least be seen; only down the Rue Bab Sidra does one get a distant
view of it. Similarly with the two forts; huddled behind houses. The
Arab walls have been finally destroyed—remnants surviving in the eastern
reach where they have been utilised (and well utilised) in the Public
Gardens.

As Alexandria grew in size and wealth she required suburbs. The earliest
development was along the line of the Mahmoudieh Canal, where the Villa
Antoniadis and a few other fine houses have been built. But with the
improvement of communications the rich merchants were able to live
further afield. Two alternatives were open to them—Mex and Ramleh—and
rather regrettably they selected the latter. Mex, with its fine natural
features, might have developed into a very beautiful place: as it is a
belt of slums have parted it from the town, and an execrable tram
service has removed it even further. The town has spread to the east
instead, to Ramleh, served at first by a railway and now by good
electric trams.

Such are the main features of Alexandria as it has evolved under
Mohammed Ali and his successors. It does not compare favourably with the
city of Alexander the Great. On the other hand it is no worse than most
nineteenth century cities. And it has one immense advantage over them—a
perfect climate.

                 THE BOMBARDMENT OF ALEXANDRIA (1882).


Thus the city develops quietly under Mohammed Ali and his successors—one
of whom, Said Pasha, is buried here. Attention was rather diverted from
her by the cutting of the Suez Canal, and it is not until 1882 that
anything of note occurs. She is in this year connected with the
rebellion of Arabi, the founder of the Egyptian Nationalist Party.
Arabi, then Minister of War, was endeavouring to dominate the Khedive
Tewfik, and to secure Egypt for the Egyptians. Alexandria, which had
held a foreign element ever since its foundation, was therefore his
natural foe, and it was here that he opened the campaign against Europe
that ended in his failure at Tel-el-Kebir. The details—like Arabi’s
motives—are complicated. But four stages may be observed.

(i). _Riot of June 11th._

This began at about 10 p.m. in the Rue des Soeurs; it is said that two
donkey boys, one Arab and one Maltese, had a fight in a café, and that
others joined in. The rioters moved down towards the Square, and at some
cross roads near the Laban Caracol the British Consul was nearly killed.
They were joined in the Square by two other mobs, one from the Attarine
Quarter and one from Ras-el-Tin. British and other warships were in the
harbour, but took no action, and the Egyptian troops in the city refused
to intervene without orders from Arabi, who was in Cairo. At last a
telegram was sent to him. He responded and the disorder ceased. There is
no reason to suppose that he planned the riot. But naturally enough he
used it to increase his prestige. He had shown the foreign communities,
and particularly the British, that he alone could give them protection.
In the evening he came down in triumph from Cairo. About 150 Europeans
are thought to have been killed that day, but we have no reliable
statistics.

(ii). _Bombardment of July 11th._

British men-of-war under Admiral Seymour had been in the harbour during
the riot, but it was a month before they took action. In the first place
the British residents had to be removed, in the second the fleet
required reinforcing, in the third orders were awaited from home. As
soon as Seymour was ready he picked a quarrel with Arabi and declared he
should bombard the city if any more guns were mounted in the forts.
Since Arabi would not agree he opened fire at 7.0 a.m. July 11th. There
were eight iron-clads—six of them the most powerful in our navy. They
were thus distributed:—_Monarch_, _Invincible_ and _Penelope_ close
inshore off Mex; _Alexandra Sultan_ and _Superb_ off Ras-el-Tin; while
the two others the _Temeraire_ and _Inflexible_ were in a central
position outside the harbour reef, half-way between Ras-el-Tin and
Marabout; and off Marabout were some gun boats, under Lord Charles
Beresford. The bombardment succeeded, though Arabi’s gunners in the
forts fought bravely. In the evening the _Superb_ blew up the powder
magazine in Fort Adda. Fort Kait Bey was also shattered and the minaret
of its 15th cent. Mosque was seen “melting away like ice in the sun.”
The town, on the other hand, was scarcely damaged, as our gunners were
careful in their aim. Arabi and his force evacuated it in the evening,
marching out by the Rue Rosette to take up a position some miles further
east, on the banks of the Mahmoudieh canal.

(iii). _Riot of July 12th._

Unfortunately Admiral Seymour, after his success, never landed a force
to keep order, and the result was a riot far more disastrous than that
of June. With the withdrawal of Arabi’s troops the native population
lost self control. The Khedive had now broken with Arabi, but during the
bombardment he had moved from Ras-el-Tin Palace to Ramleh and his
authority was negligible. Pillaging went on all day on the 12th, and by
the evening the city had been set on fire. The damage was material
rather than artistic, the one valuable object in the Square, the statue
of Mohammed Ali, fortunately escaping. Rues Chérif and Tewfik
Pacha—indeed all the roads leading out of the Square—were destroyed, and
nearly every street in the European quarter was impassable through
fallen and falling houses. Empty jewel cases and broken clocks lay on
the pavements. Every shop was looted, and by the time Admiral Seymour
did land it was impossible for his middies to buy any jam; one of them
has recorded this misfortune, adding that in other ways Alexandria, then
in flames, was “well enough.” Meanwhile the Khedive had returned to his
Palace, and order was slowly restored. It is not known how many lives
were lost in this avoidable disaster.

(iv). _Military Operations._

A large British force was despatched under Lord Wolseley to the Suez
Canal—the force that finally defeated Arabi at Tel-el-Kebir. But, until
it reached Egypt, Alexandria remained in danger, for Arabi might attack
from his camp at Kafr-el-Dawar. So the city had to be defended on the
east. In the middle of July General Alison arrived with a few troops,
including artillery, and occupied the barracks at Mustapha Pacha, the
hill of Abou el Nawatir, and the water works down by the canal. He could
thus watch Arabi’s movements. And he had a second strongly fortified
position at the gates of the Antoniadis Gardens, in case he was attacked
from the south. Here he was able to hold on and to harry the enemy’s
outposts until pressure was relieved. His losses were slight; the
regiments involved are commemorated by tablets in the English church.
Next month Wolseley arrived, and having inspected the position
re-embarked his troops and pretended that he was going to land at
Aboukir. Arabi was deceived and prepared resistance there. Wolseley
steamed past him, and landed at Port Said instead. Arabi then had to
break up his camp, and the danger for Alexandria was over.

                              CONCLUSION.


Since the bombardment of 1882, the city has known other troubles, but
they will not be here described. Nor will any peroration be attempted,
for the reason that Alexandria is still alive and alters even while one
tries to sum her up. Politically she is now more closely connected with
the rest of Egypt than ever in the past, but the old foreign elements
remain, and it is to the oldest of them, the Greek, that she owes such
modern culture as is to be found in her. Her future like that of other
great commercial cities is dubious. Except in the cases of the Public
Gardens and the Museum, the Municipality has scarcely risen to its
historic responsibilities. The Library is starved for want of funds, the
Art Gallery cannot be alluded to, and links with the past have been
wantonly broken—for example the name of the Rue Rosette has been altered
and the exquisite Covered Bazaar near the Rue de France destroyed.
Material prosperity based on cotton, onions, and eggs, seems assured,
but little progress can be discerned in other directions, and neither
the Pharos of Sostratus nor the Idylls of Theocritus nor the Enneads of
Plotinus are likely to be rivalled in the future. Only the climate only
the north wind and the sea remain as pure as when Menelaus the first
visitor landed upon Ras-el-Tin, three thousand years ago; and at night
the constellation of Berenice’s Hair still shines as brightly as when it
caught the attention of Conon the astronomer.




                        THE GOD ABANDONS ANTONY.


    When at the hour of midnight
    an invisible choir is suddenly heard passing
    with exquisite music, with voices—
    Do not lament your fortune that at last subsides,
    your life’s work that has failed, your schemes that have proved
       illusions.
    But like a man prepared, like a brave man,
    bid farewell to her, to Alexandria who is departing.
    Above all, do not delude yourself, do not say that it is a dream,
    that your ear was mistaken.
    Do not condescend to such empty hopes.
    Like a man for long prepared, like a brave man,
    like to the man who was worthy of such a city,
    go to the window firmly,
    and listen with emotion,
    but not with the prayers and complaints of the coward
    (Ah! supreme rapture!)
    listen to the notes, to the exquisite instruments of the mystic
       choir,
    and bid farewell to her, to Alexandria whom you are losing.

                                                        C. P. CAVAFY.[6]

                  FROM THE SQUARE TO THE Rue Rosette.




ROUTE:—Square, Rue Chérif Pacha, Rue Rosette, leading through the most
modern section of the town. No tram line.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—Square and Statue of Mohammed Ali; Banco di
Roma; Mosque of the Prophet Daniel; St. Saba; Greco-Roman Museum.




                              THE SQUARE.


_The Square_ (officially, Place Mohammed Ali; formerly Place des
Consuls; known to cabmen as “Menschieh” from the adjoining Police
Station) was laid out by Mohammed Ali as the centre of his new city.
(About 1830; see p. 92). In Ptolemaic times the ground here was under
the sea. The Square is over 100 yds. broad and nearly 500 long and well
planted, but unworthy buildings surround it. It suffered in the riots of
1882 (p. 95.) everything was then burnt excepting the statue of Mohammed
Ali and the Church of St. Mark.

In the Centre:—_Equestrian Statue of Mohammed Ali_, an impressive
specimen of French Sculpture, by Jacquemart, exhibited in the Salon of
1872. Orthodox Mohammedans were hostile to its erection, and even now
there is no inscription on it. Its presence is the more welcome since it
is one of the few first class objects in the city. It should be studied
from every point of view.

Right as one faces the Statue:—_The Mixed Tribunals_, where, in
accordance with arrangements dating from 1875, civil and commercial
cases between Egyptians and Europeans are tried.

Left:—_The French Gardens_, a pleasant strip, stretching at right angles
from the Square to the New Quays, (p. 140).

Also left:—_Anglican Church of St. Mark_, which with the adjacent St.
Mark’s Buildings was built on land granted to the English by Mohammed
Ali. Looking through the railings of the church-yard is the funny little
bust of General Earle (k. 1885 at Kirbekan in the Soudan). It was
erected by the European Community, and represents their chief incursion
into the realms of art. The Church itself, considering its date (1855),
and its pseudo-Byzantine architecture, is however a tolerable building.
The interior is restful and the stained glass and triptych in the
chancel strike a pleasing note of colour. Historically, its only
associations are with the fighting against Arabi in 1882 (p. 93). The
Regiments it commemorates are the 2nd Bn. Duke of Cornwall’s Light
infantry (on the scroll by the entrance stairs); 2nd. Bn. Derbyshires;
Royal Marine Artillery; 1st. Bn. London Division; Royal Artillery 1st
Bn. Royal West Kents (in the Nave). In the churchyard trees
multitudinous, sparrows gather at sunset, and fill the Square with their
chatter.

End of the Square:—_The Bourse_, with arcaded exterior and clock. Inside
is the Cotton Exchange, the chief in the Egyptian trade; the howls and
cries that may be heard here of a morning proceed not from a menagerie
but from the wealthy merchants of Alexandria as they buy and sell. At
the other end of the same hall is the Stock Exchange. The whole scene is
well worth a visit (introduction necessary).

                  *       *       *       *       *

_Rue Chérif Pacha_, a smart little street bristling with flag staffs,
leads out of the Square to the left of the Bourse. Here are the best
shops. Towards the end, left, at the entrance of the Rue Toussoum Pacha,
is the _Banco di Roma_, the finest building in the city. Architect,
Gorra. A modified copy of the famous Palazzo Farnese, which Antonio da
San Gallo and Michelangelo built in the 16th cent., at Rome. The
materials are artificial stone and narrow bricks of a charming pale red.
It has two stories as against the Farnese’s three, but there is a sort
of half storey up under the heavy cornice. Each side of the door are
elaborate torch holders of bent iron; over door, the Wolf of Rome. In a
cosmopolitan city like Alexandria, which has never evolved an
architecture of its own, there is nothing incongruous in this copy of
the Italian Renaissance. A little further up Rue Toussoum Pacha is the
_Land Bank of Egypt_, with a good semi-circular portico.

Rue Chérif Pacha then joins the Rue Rosette.




                              Rue Rosette.


This street, despite its modern appearance, is the most ancient in the
city. It runs on the lines of the Canopic Way, the central artery of
Alexander’s town, (p. 10), and under the Ptolemies it was lined from end
to end with marble colonnades. Its full title is “Rue de la Porte
Rosette” from the Rosetta Gate in the old Arab walls through which it
passed out eastwards (p. 81). The Municipality have recently changed its
name to the unmeaning Rue Fouad Premier, thus breaking one of the few
links that bound their city to the past.

At its entrance, right, are:—the Caracol Attarine (British Main Guard);
the Rue de la Gare du Caire, leading to the main railway station; and
the Mohammed Ali Club, the chief in the town—a small temple to Serapis
once stood on its site. Here too is Cook’s office.

100 yds. down it is crossed by the Rue Nebi Daniel and by a tramway.
Here, in ancient times, was the main crossway of the ancient city—one of
the most glorious places in the world (p. 10). Achilles Tatius, a bishop
who in A.D. 400 wrote a somewhat foolish and improper novel called
Clitophon and Leucippe, thus describes it:—

    The first thing one noticed in entering Alexandria by the Gate of
    the Sun (i.e. by the Rosetta Gate) was the beauty of the city. A
    range of columns went from one end of it to the other. Advancing
    down them, I came in time to the place that bears the name of
    Alexander, and there could see the other half of the town, which was
    equally beautiful. For just as the colonnades stretched ahead of me,
    so did other colonnades now appear at right angles to them.

Thus the tramway was also lined with marble once.

Turning to the right, a few yards up the Rue Nebi Daniel, we come
to:—_The Mosque of the Prophet Daniel_ which stands on the site of
Alexander’s tomb—the “Soma” where he and some of the Ptolemies lay,
buried in the Macedonian fashion (p. 19). The cellars have never been
explored, and there is a gossipy story that Alexander still lies in one
of them, intact: a dragoman from the Russian Consulate, probably a liar,
said in 1850 that he saw through a hole in a wooden door “a human body
in a sort of glass cage with a diadem on its head and half bowed on a
sort of elevation or throne. A quantity of books or papyrus were
scattered around.” The present Mosque, though the chief in the city, is
uninteresting; a paved approach, a white washed door, a great interior
supported by four colonnades with slightly pointed arches. The praying
niche faces south instead of the usual east. All has been mercilessly
restored. Stairs lead down to two tombs, assigned to the Prophet Daniel
and to the mythical Lukman the Wise; it is uncertain why or when such a
pair visited our city. The tombs stand in a well-crypt of cruciform
shape, above which is a chapel roofed by a dome and entered from the
mosque through a door. Here and there some decorations struggle through
the whitewash.

In a building to the right of the approach to the Mosque are the _Tombs
of the Khedivial Family_, worth seeing for their queerness; there is
nothing like them in Alexandria. The Mausoleum is cruciform, painted to
imitate marble, and covered with Turkish carpets. Out of the carpet rise
the tombs, of all sizes but of similar design, and all painted white and
gold. A red tarboosh indicates a man, a crown with conventionalised hair
a woman. The most important person buried here is Said Pacha—third tomb
on the right. He was the son of Mohammed Ali and ruled Egypt 1854-1863:
Mohammed Ali himself lies at Cairo.

Between the Mausoleum and the street:—a fountain with eaves and a dome;
Turkish style.

Opposite the Mosque:—some antique columns used as gate posts; perhaps
the facade of the Mouseion stretched along here (p. 17).

Behind the Mosque:—Fort of Kom-el-Dik. View. Site of ancient Paneum or
Park of Pan—the summit of the hill was then carved into a pinecone,
which a spiral path ascended.—In Arab times the walls of the shrunken
city passed to the south of Kom-el-Dik, (p. 81), and a fine stretch of
them still survives, half-way between the base of the Fort and the
railway station; they border the road, but cannot be seen from it, being
sunken; they include a moat.—Beyond the Fort the high ground continues;
the little Arab quarter of Kom-el-Dik is built along its crest, and the
winding lanes, though insignificant, contrast pleasantly with the glare
of the European town.

We return to the Rue Rosette.

A little further down the Rue Rosette a turning on the left leads to the
_Church and Convent of St. Saba_, the seat of the Greek Orthodox
Patriarch. (For history of Patriarchate _see_ p. 211). A church was
founded here in 615, on the site of a Temple of Apollo. The present
group dates from 1687, and has an old world atmosphere that is rare in
Alexandria. In the quiet court of the Convent are three tomb stones of
British soldiers, dating from Napoleonic times: Colonel Arthur Brice of
the Coldstreams, k. in the Battle of Alexandria, 1801 (p. 88) Thomas
Hamilton Scott of the 78th, and Henry Gosle, military apothecary, who
both died during General Frazer’s disastrous “reconnoitering”
expedition, 1807, (p. 89).—From the court, steps descend to the church
which has been odiously restored. In the nave, eight ancient columns of
granite, now smeared with chocolate paint. In the apse of the sanctuary,
fresco of the Virgin and Child. Right—Chapel of St. George with a table
said to be 4th cent., and an interesting picture of the Council of
Nicaea (p. 48); the Emperor Constantine presides with the bishops around
him and the heretic Arius at his feet. Left—Chapel of St. Catherine of
Alexandria, with a block of marble purporting to come from the column
where the saint was martyred.—Hanging outside the church, three fine
bells.

At the top of the street, to left, is the Greek Hospital, a pleasant
building that stands in a garden.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The Rue Rosette now passes the Native Courts (left) and reaches the
Municipal Buildings. Behind the latter, a few yards up the Rue du Musée,
is the Municipal Library; go up the steps opposite the entrance gate;
push the door. The Library is good considering its miserable endowment;
the city that once had the greatest Library in the world now cannot
afford more than £300 per annum for the combined purchase and binding of
her books.

Beyond the library is a far more adequate institution—the Greco-Roman
Museum.




                        THE GRECO-ROMAN MUSEUM.


The collection was not formed until 1891, by which time most of the
antiques in the neighbourhood had passed into private hands. It is
consequently not of the first order and little in it has outstanding
beauty. Used rightly, it is of great value, but the visitor who “goes
through” it will find afterwards that it has gone through him, and that
he is left with nothing but a vague memory of fatigue. The absence of
colour, the numerous small exhibits in terra cotta and limestone, will
tend to depress him, and to give a false impression of a civilization
which, whatever its defects, was not dull. He should not visit the
collection until he has learned or imagined something about the ancient
city, and he should visit certain definite objects, and then come away—a
golden rule indeed in all museums. He may then find that a scrap of the
past has come alive.


[Illustration: PLAN OF GRECO-ROMAN MUSEUM]


The collection is well housed (date of building 1895) and well
catalogued. There is a Guide (in French) by the Director, Professor
Breccia, extracts from which are pasted up about the rooms. On this
scholarly work the following notes are based. They are compiled,
however, from a particular point of view. They attempt to illustrate the
historical section of the book (p. 1), and are connected with it by
cross references.

For arrangement of exhibits, see Plan p. 108.

INTRODUCTION.

The Museum mainly illustrates the civilization of Ancient Alexandria.
There are some portraits—not satisfactory—of the Founder (Room 12), and
magnificent coins of the Ptolemies (Room 3); also sculptures of them
(Rooms 4, 12). Their religious policy appears in the statues of Serapis
(Room 16). As for the Roman Emperors, we have besides their coins (Room
2) colossal statues of Marcus Aurelius (Room 12), and of Diocletian (?)
(Room 17); then some gold coins of their Byzantine successors (Room 5).
Meanwhile the career of the private citizen is also being illustrated,
but mainly in his grave. Masses and masses and masses of funerary stuff
(Rooms 6, 13, 14, 15, 17-21), mostly dull, but attaining great beauty in
the terra cotta statuettes of women (Room 18). The “Egyptian Queen”
pottery (Room 17) is more cheerful. In the same room is lovely glass.
With Christianity, the Alexandrian, though still mainly presented to us
through his tombs (Room 1), develops the interesting cult of St. Menas
(Rooms 1, 5, 22, A.).

                  *       *       *       *       *

The Museum also exhibits, though imperfectly, other aspects of Egyptian
life.

(i). PHARAONIC EGYPT:—There are some mummies, etc. from Thebes,
Heliopolis, etc. (Rooms 8 and 10), but they have the air of being here
because not good enough for Cairo; also a collection of small objects
(Room 10), and Rameses statues from Aboukir (Room 9 and North Garden).
The blend of Pharaonic and Hellenistic is shown in Room 11.

(ii). THE FAYOUM:—This is the most important non-Alexandrian section in
the Museum. The Fayoum, an irrigated depression south-west of Cairo, was
developed by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and, as in Alexandria, Greek and
Egyptian mingled, but with different results. It was barbaric and
provincial. Note especially crocodile worship (North Garden, Rooms 9, 22
A). Mummies of quite a new type (Room 17). Black basalt statues (Room
11). It is a pity that the Fayoum exhibits cannot all be shown together.

(iii). AKHMIN:—An early Christian Necropolis in Upper Egypt. Hence come
the robed mummies (Room 1), and the fragments of tapestry (Rooms 1, 2,
4), whose beauty will linger when many a grandiose statue has been
forgotten.

VESTIBULE.

PLANS, PHOTOGRAPHS, ETC.

Note especially (1) Thiersch’s reconstruction of the Pharos and (10)
Photographs of Kait Bey Fort, where the Pharos stood. (p. 16). (8)
Cleopatra’s Needle in situ (p. 161). At the entrance of Room 6 (left) is
a cast of the Rosetta Stone (p. 185) which contains a tri-lingual decree
(Hieroglyph, which was the script of the Ancient Egyptian priests,
Demotic, a running hand-writing evolved from it, and Greek); the decree
was passed by the priests of Memphis, B.C. 196, in honour of Ptolemy V
Epiphanes. The original stone was discovered by the French in 1799 in
the Fort of St. Julien, Rosetta—water-colour of it hangs close by.
General Menou had to surrender it to the English in 1801, and it is now
in the British Museum. Carducci’s fine poem on Alexandria hangs framed
on the adjacent wall.

In the case are stone-age tools from the Fayoum.

From the Vestibule are: right, Room 1 (Christianity); left, Room 6
(Inscriptions); straight ahead, the Verandah leads between the Garden
Courts to Room 17.

ROOM 1: CHRISTIAN REMAINS.

RIGHT WALL: Inscriptions. 106 shows a cross with a looped top, directly
derived from the symbol of life (ankh) that the ancient Egyptian gods
carry (p. 69). In the middle of the wall _Case A_: terra cotta dolls,
etc. from St. Menas.

CENTRE OF ROOM: facing door:—magnificent Byzantine capital, supposed to
have been in the church of St. Mark (p. 46). Found in the Rue Ramleh.
_Case K_: Carved ivories and bones, mostly from Alexandrian rubbish
heaps—1979, 2012, 2021, 2025 are good examples. _Case I_: Interlaced
cushion from the Christian necropolis of Antinoe, Upper Egypt. Middle of
room: fine porphyry cover to a sarcophagus, decorated on each side by a
charming head. From the Lebban quarter. Beyond: Christian mummies from
Antinoe, still wearing their fine embroideries. At the end: another
Byzantine capital, found near the Mahmoudieh Canal.

LEFT WALL, centre: _Cases La_ and _M_.: Flasks from St. Menas. They were
filled with water, which must soon have evaporated, and exported all
over the Christian world: usual design—the Saint between camels. Between
the vases interesting fragments from a church to St. Menas at Dekhela;
(p. 171), the bas-relief of the Saint is a clumsy copy of the one that
stood in his shrine in the desert (p. 195). _Cases P._, _Q._, _R._,
_S._: Coptic tapestries from Akhmin and Antinoe—beautiful. Date 3rd
cent. onward. Near _Case N_, two absurd reliefs (Christian era) of Leda
and the swan—in one of them she holds an egg.

ROOM 2: COINS.

Chronological continuation of the Ptolemaic coins in Room 3, which
should be visited first. Illustrate history of Alexandria, and also her
religion, under Rome and afterwards under Constantinople. Series begins
in _Case A_ (further right-hand corner) with Octavian (Augustus) 675;
_Case B_ No. 675 (of Domitian) shows the Pharos (_see_ p. 16). 750 (of
Trajan)—a temple to Isis in Alexandria, with pylons between which the
goddess stands. 771 shows Serapis on his throne. 890-892, the sacred
basket that he sometimes carries on his head. _Case C_,
1363-1366—interviews, very friendly, between the emperor Hadrian and
Alexandria. 1409—interviews between him and the god Serapis. 1450, Isis
as guardian of the Pharos.

ROUND THE ROOM: Four marble capitals from St. Menas.

ROOM 3: COINS.

The collection of Ptolemaic coins begins in _Case Ab_ (right of room)
and continues through _Case C-D_ (left) and _Case E-F_ (entrance). The
coins are numbered consecutively. They are of great historical and
artistic interest, but must not be taken seriously as portraits, since
the ruler is generally approximated to some god (_i.e._ numeral ‘one’
1). Silver four drachma of Alexander the Great, struck by his Viceroy
Cleomenes. 2-45. Ptolemy I as Viceroy. On the obverse is always the head
of Alexander the Great, with horns of the God Ammon. 46-274. Ptolemy I
as King (Soter). A new type gradually appears; on the obverse the head
of the King, on the reverse an eagle (note 14 gold coins—four-drachma
pieces). 275-510. Ptolemy II (Philadelphus) instructive for the domestic
history of his reign (p. 14). At first the King appears alone—_e.g._ on
gold five-drachma. 275-280. Then his formidable sister and wife Arsinoe
is alone—gold coin 342. Then the couple appear together—gold 428-434,
while on the other side of the coins are their predecessors, Ptolemy I
and his wife, to show that the dynasty emanated in pairs. 551-619.
Ptolemy III (Euergetes). 620. Magnificent gold eight-drachma,
representing Euergetes, but struck by Philopator his son; the most
gorgeous coin in the collection. 621. Silver four drachma, with heads of
Serapis and Isis. Ptolemaic coinage now deteriorates; the eagle in the
later issues (_Case D_) becomes formalised and ridiculous. 1059 (_Case
E_) features—what disillusionment!—Cleopatra!

ROUND THE ROOM—Casts.

ROOM 4: COINS. AKHMIN TAPESTRY.

The coins are coppers of the later Roman Emperors. Not beautiful. Of
historical interest to Alexandria. In _Case A-B_ (right) 3884—Aurelian
and Vabatathe. 3896—Zenobia. In _Case C-D_ (left) 4024—Diocletian.

ROUND THE WALLS: 1-8. Tapestries from the Christian cemetery at Akhmin.

BACK WALL: Large and impressive statue of a mourning woman with her
child. Hellenistic. Perhaps represents Berenice wife of Ptolemy III
Euergetes, mourning for her little daughter—the daughter whom the
priests deified in the Decree of Canopus, B.C. 239 (p. 42).

ENTRANCE OF ROOM: Large Christian Jar.

ROOM 5: COINS.

Beautiful Byzantine gold coins. Note especially the Emperor Phocas and
his conqueror Heraclius (p. 53); the latter displays the Exaltation of
the Cross, recovered by him from the Persians.

BACK WALL: Pilaster from the Hospice at St. Menas. The cross has been
erased, probably at the Arab conquest. At each end of it, more St. Menas
flasks.

_Case A_: Painted masks, from the (pagan) Necropolis of Antinoe. _Case
B_: Christian potteries from Kom es Chogafa.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Return to Vestibule.

ROOM 6: INSCRIPTIONS, ETC.

This room contains nothing of beauty, but is interesting historically.
The exhibits are not in numerical order.

RIGHT WALL, close to entrance: 42—Inscription on a statue of Antony (p.
26), dedicated on December 24th, B.C. 50 (Found near Ramleh Station,
_i.e._ the site of the Caesareum). 2. Dedication to Ptolemy II
Philadelphus. 1. Dedication to Ptolemy I. 37. Doorway with inscription
to Ptolemy VI; in it is a case containing (59) two bronze plaques
belonging to a Roman Soldier, (Julius Saturninus), inscribed with a
certificate of his good services and privileges. 61_a_, also in the
case, is another military document, a wooden tablet written at
Alexandria, but found in the Fayoum, and also conferring benefits on a
veteran. 94. Base of a statue of the Emperor Valentinian (4th Cent.
A.D.); found in Rue Rosette. 88_b_. Tombstone with the figures of
Isidore and Artemisia, two ladies of Pisidia, found at Hadra. 87_b_.
Tombstone of a lady with her servant.

Then come some painted tombstones protected by glass; they are inferior
to some in the rooms further on. 119 (in corner of room); Tombstone of a
woman expiring between two friends.

LEFT WALL: Inscriptions and tombstones of the Roman period (p. 44). 480.
On a pedestal: Memorial of Aurelius Alexander, a Roman soldier of
Macedonian birth who died aged 31. 252. Another of Aurelius Sabius, a
Syrian soldier, aged 35.

EACH SIDE OF THE ROOM, near entrance door: Two _Cases_ of papyri—the
left hand one containing two interesting inscriptions. 119. Incantation
to the Nile and to the great spirit Sabaoth shewing mixture of Egyptian
and Jewish faiths. 122. Demand of Aurelia, priestess of the crocodile
god, Petesouchos, for certificate of having worshipped the gods. It was
made during the Decian persecution, (p. 46), and suggests that, despite
her position, she had been accused of Christianity. 352_b_. On a
pedestal: Colossal scarab. 35_b_. Fine headless sphinx. 351. Great Apis
bull (restored); period of Hadrian. 350. Sphinx, rather sentimental,
with crossed paws. All these last four were found near Pompey’s Pillar.
(p. 144).

ROOM 7: ANCIENT EGYPT: CANOPUS.

These monuments, though mostly found in the Aboukir sites (p. 180), may
have been imported there at some unknown date from Heliopolis or Sais.

1. Statue of a Hyksos Pharaoh (Shepherd King, about B.C. 1800) which has
been appropriated by Rameses II (B.C. 1300); on the shoulder appears
Rameses’ daughter Hout-Ma-Ra, traditionally the princess who found Moses
in the bullrushes.

18. Part of a statue of Rameses II.

_Case C_ (left of room). Two statues of a Ptolemaic official; from the
Temple of Serapis, Alexandria, (p. 146).

ROOM 8: ANCIENT EGYPT.

Five mummy cases.

_Case B_ (right): The interior is painted—an eerie receptacle. By the
head, a winged serpent; along the sides, a serpent with the sign of Life
(cf. the Coptic Cross, Room 1, No. 106, also p. 69), and genii, mostly
serpent-headed. The mummy lay on the sun-goddess Neith, on a serpent
entwined round a lotus, and on the soul as a bird. The outside of the
case is also painted. From Deir el Bahri, Upper Egypt.

_Case E_ (centre): Richly painted mummy with the goddess Neith on its
breast. Very effective. Date—about B.C. 600.

3 (back wall): Relief from over the door of a tomb. Left the deceased,
enthroned between two bouquets of lotus: to one of them a couple of
ducks are tied. Then comes an old harpist, who is singing, accompanied
by a girl on a drum, and by two others who clap their hands. To the
right, a man preparing drink; then two dancing girls. Beautiful work.
From Heliopolis.

ROOM 9: ANCIENT EGYPT: CROCODILE WORSHIP.

The contents of this room, though not Alexandrian, are Ptolemaic, and
well illustrate that dynasty in its Egyptian aspect. They come from the
Temple of Petesouchos, the crocodile god of the Fayoum. The temple was
adorned by Agathodorus, a Greek official there B.C. 137, in honour of
Ptolemy VII (Physkon) and of his two wives, one his sister, one his
niece, and both called Cleopatra. (For the marriage arrangements of this
unattractive monarch, _see_ tree, p. 12). The temple itself has been in
part brought to the Museum, and well set up in the North Garden (_see_
below).

CENTRE OF ROOM: Wooden stretcher on which is a mummied crocodile. It was
carried thus in procession by the priests, as the water colour below
(copy of a fresco) shows. The stretcher rests on a wooden chest, also
found in the shrine.

BACK WALL: Wooden door of the outer gateway (_see_ North Garden). Greek
inscription. Here are some photographs by which the temple can be
reconstructed.

39 (right of the chest): an offering table to the god, ornate and
unpleasing. He lies in a little tank.

LEFT OF THE ENTRANCE DOOR: Relief of a priest adoring the god, who
crawls upon lotus flowers.

ROOM 10: ANCIENT EGYPT: SMALL EXHIBITS.

IN THE ENTRANCE: Offering table, with basins for the libations.

RIGHT WALL—_Case C_; Statuettes of gods, all named. The most interesting
for the history of Alexandria are 3-25 Osiris, and 26-40 the bull Apis,
with whom he was compounded to make Serapis. (p. 18).

_Case D_: Mummies of a baby, of an eagle, of an ibis.

_Case Aa—Shelf b_ (at the top): winged scarabs in blue enamel. _Shelf k_
(No. 1): statuette of Sekhet, goddess of the heat of the sun—she has the
head of a lioness and holds a gold flower. _Shelf f_: Bast, the cat-god.
No. 39 has a kitten between the paws. 51 gold earrings. _Shelf 1_ has
more statues of Bast. 55 very good.

LEFT WALL: _Case h_ “Canopic” vases of alabaster. Used to hold those
parts of the dead that could not be embalmed. Each dedicated to a son of
Horus. Amset held the stomach; Hapi the intestines; Douamoutef the
lungs; Kebehsenouf the liver. For their connection with the town of
Canopus, _see_ p. 176.

_Case Bb_:—More statuettes—especially _shelf i_.—Harpocrates and Horus,
and _shelf k_. Isis nursing Horus—the artistic origin for the Christian
design of the Madonna and Child. (p. 69). There are some rattles and
vases of the Isis cult.

_Case L_: Little serving figures (Ushabti), which were put in the grave
with the mummy to do the work for it in the underworld.

Also round the wall of the room: six painted mummy cases.

Down the middle: two big tables of scarabs, amulets, gold trinkets, etc.

ROOM 11. GRECO-EGYPTIAN.

Objects in which the Greek and Egyptian influences mingle. They are few
in number, and not as interesting as one might expect. No living art was
born from the union.

RIGHT WALL: 18. Dedication to the Egyptian god Anubis with a Greek
inscription. 20. Profile of a Ptolemy—rather charming. 33-40. Serpent
worship—very repulsive. 40. is a curious mixture. The male snake has the
basket of Serapis and the club of Hercules; the female, the disc of Isis
and the sheaf of Ceres. 41. Bad painting, Greek style, of a girl with
Egyptian gods round her. From Gabbari.

END WALL—both sides: 43-53. Clumsy statues from the Fayoum, in which
Greek influence appears.

LEFT WALL—centre: 61. Large fragment of a relief from a temple at Benha;
left, Horus with a falcon’s head; right, a human figure, by whose side
is a Greek inscription. 62. Model of a shrine, mixed style: in the
sanctuary Isis nurses Horus. 69. (in _case A_)—beautiful statue
(headless) of a woman, Egyptian style, but Greek feeling.

Archway between Rooms 11 and 12. ON RIGHT: Portrait of a youth in white
marble (from Kom es Chogafa). LEFT: Pleasing portrait of a child of two
or three years of age.

ROOM 12: PORTRAITS: MOSTLY GRECO-ROMAN IN STYLE.

CENTRE: 30. Dull colossal statue of Marcus Aurelius. The Emperor,
looking bored but benignant, appears as a general: his right arm rests
on a cornucopia. A cross has in Christian times been scratched on the
stomach of the cuirass.—From Rue Rosette.

RIGHT WALL: 8. Exquisite bust of Venus; 16_a_ and 17. Heads, in marble
and granite, of Alexander the Great (p. 8); of no artistic merit; but
found in Alexandria. 18. Head of a young soldier. 20. Marble head of a
goddess; beautiful hair. Found near Pompey’s Pillar. 21. Head, perhaps
of Berenice wife of Euergetes; found in same place.—_Cabinet A_: small
portraits: note as especially fine 15 and 15_a_ Ptolemy Euergetes (?)
and 12 Berenice his wife (?) with elaborate curls; they stand in the
centre of the case on the second shelf. _Cabinet D_: Alleged portrait in
marble of Cleopatra in her declining years. Thin, firmly compressed lips
and general expression of severity discredit the theory. 60. Colossal
granite head of Ptolemy IV Philopator; from Aboukir.

LEFT WALL: 51. Bust of Emperor Hadrian. 52. Head in white marble—noble
features, supposed to be those of Marcus Aurelius in youth. _Cabinet B._
Heads and torsos: No. 27 Centre shelf, Head of a child with radiant
smile—found in Alexandria. 36. Head of Zeus, hirsute countenance—thick
lips. Has been scalped. _Cabinet F._ Various small bronzes; 44.
Life-sized head of woman in marble: has Rosetti-like neck and mouth.

ROOM 13. MISCELLANEOUS.

CENTRE: 1. Statue of an Emperor, on which a head of Septimus Severus has
been fixed.

In _Case F_ (right): 2. Smiling face of a Faun. On the top of the case,
a queer relief of a winged griffin and a woman on two wheels.
(Nemesis?).

In _Case H_ (left): 2. Caricature of a Roman senator with a rat’s head.

ROOM 14. MISCELLANEOUS.

CENTRE: Mosaic from Gabbari, once displaying a Medusa’s head.

BACK WALL: 1. Marble statue of a Roman Orator. The head does not belong.

LEFT CORNER: 2-4. Delicate architectural details. From Rue Sultan
Hussein.

LEFT WALL: 6. Door of a tomb-niche, blending Greek and Egyptian styles.
The table in front is from the same tomb and was used for funeral
offering. From the Western Necropolis.

ROOM 15. ARCHITECTURAL.

    Small fragments, etc., many of them very dainty and showing traces
    of paint.

    RIGHT WALL: 9. Sacrificial altar, imitating a building, with doors
    realistically ajar.

    On a column in the right-hand corner: 2. Capital, well illustrating
    mixture of styles; the general form and the acanthus leaves are
    Greek, the lotus, papyrus, and serpents are Egyptian.

    MIDDLE WALL, behind a curtain: 20. Painted side of a sarcophagus; a
    shallow and pretty design of two game cocks about to fight across a
    festoon of flowers. 2nd Cent. A.D.

        LEFT WALL: 50. Other side of same sarcophagus: buildings in
        perspective.

    ROOM 16. STATUES, MOSTLY GRECO-ROMAN IN STYLE.

    RIGHT WALL: 4. Marble torso of a young hero or god; the head and
    arms, which were worked separately, are lost, good work. From
    Alexandria—probably on a temple. 7-8. _On a shelf_—Statuettes,
    headless and insignificant, but interesting for their
    subject:—Alexander the Great as a god with the aegis. From
    Alexandria. 12. On a column—Bust of the composite-goddess
    Demeter-Selene, showing head-dress of Demeter and horns of the moon.
    21-23: Priestesses of Isis, recognisable by the sacred knots into
    which their shawls are tied in front. 28. Large Ionic capital;
    another stands opposite, four others in the garden court. From
    Silsileh, and is probably part of the Ptolemaic Palace. (p. 17) 27.
    Greek funeral relief, as old as 3rd Cent. B.C. Found at Alexandria,
    but probably imported from Athens.

    CENTRE OF ROOM: 31. Fine bath of black stone, decorated with heads
    of lions and of a lynx, through whom the water escaped. Further on
    (37) is another. Both from the Western Necropolis, where they were
    used as tombs. 33. Colossal votive foot, merging above the ankle
    into a bust of Serapis. On the head a Greek dedication, to Serapis
    from two of his worshippers; two serpents above with a child
    (Horus?) between them. From Alexandria. 34. An immense eagle, rather
    cumbersome, and presented by the late Khedive; from the island of
    Thasos. 39. Gigantic forearm, holding a sphere. From Benha.

    LEFT WALL: 40. Big limestone Corinthian capital. 3rd cent. B.C. 47,
    48, 49, 51, and (_on shelf_) 53 and 52_a_: Statues and Heads of
    Serapis. Important (p. 19). 47 is probably a Roman copy of the
    original—ascribed to Bryaxis—in the Temple, and well renders the
    type—half terrible half benign. On its head are the marks where the
    sacred basket was attached. From the Rue Adib. 48. shows Cerberus.
    52 and 52_a_ were found near the actual Serapeum; the blue-black
    colour of the latter recalls the original statue. 50. Priest of
    Serapis (?) headless; robe with seven-rayed stars, scarabs, the
    crescent moon. Apis Bulls and a great serpent. From the Temple. 53.
    Realistic Portrait head. 54. Apollo seated on the Omphalos, or Navel
    of the World at Delphi; a rare subject; probably imported from
    Antioch, Asia Minor. 59-59. Headless statues, Roman, some with rolls
    of papyrus by them. From Sidi Gaber. 62. Entrance of Room 17: Genius
    of Death asleep.

    ROOM 17: MISCELLANEOUS.

    An interesting room.

    CENTRE: Delightful mosaic of a water party in Upper Egypt; birds,
    frogs, eels, fish, hippopotami and pigmies; in the middle a lady and
    gentleman with their offspring and an attendant recline beneath an
    awning that sways in the wind. Caesar and Cleopatra may have
    disported themselves thus (p. 25). Greek inscription and ornamental
    border.

    BACK WALL: Colossal headless porphyry statue of Diocletian (?) on a
    throne. From Rue Attarine.

    IN FRONT OF STATUE: Marble sarcophagus; Dionysus and Ariadne. From
    the Western Necropolis. The type is rare in Alexandria, the
    decorations being generally fruit or flowers.

    PLACED ABOUT THE ROOM: Mummies from the Fayoum (_see_ preliminary
    note); the best (_Case U_) stands against a pillar; it has a
    realistic portrait of the deceased, painted on wood.

    ROUND THE WALLS: _Case A_ Lovely iridescent glass; the Alexandrian
    glass was famous. _Case D_, terra cotta dish for serving poached
    eggs. _Table Rr_: Funerary objects from the Western Necropolis;
    2506, &c., Gnostic Amulets (p. 71). _Case G_ and adjoining _Table
    S_: Fragments of “Egyptian Queen” pottery, a commercial product of
    Ptolemaic times. The type was a green enamel vase on which was a
    relief of a princess sacrificing at an altar with some such
    inscription as “Good luck to Queen Berenice.” These vases were
    bought as ornaments by loyal citizens and tourists. _Case G_:
    Funerary furniture; in the centre a skull, wreathed with artificial
    laurel. 3rd cent. B.C. (From the Chatby Necropolis. p. 164). _Case
    K_: Fine cinerary urns, dated—earliest, 281 B.C.—Right and left of
    the door into the gardens; Marble sarcophagi of the usual
    Alexandrian design. _Cases P_. Glass vases of exquisite hue and
    design; there is more beauty in this little case than in tons of
    statues.

    ROOM 18. TERRA COTTA STATUETTES.

    The statuettes, of which the best are Hellenistic and Alexandrian,
    were at first connected with funeral rites and later placed in the
    tomb from the sentiment that prompts us to drop flowers, especially
    when the dead person is young. They have mostly been found in the
    tombs of children and women. They are the loveliest things in the
    Museum.

    FACING ENTRANCE, and to right, (_Cases HH_ and _A_): Cinerary urns
    from Alexandria.

    LEFT WALL: _Case F_ (covered with curtain): Here are the
    masterpieces—27 statuettes of women. 1, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, are the
    most beautiful perhaps—so delicate but so dignified. 1. is crowned
    with ivy and wears tiny earrings; the shape of her arm shown through
    the wrap that covers it. 7. carries her child. 12. with her little
    draped head is curiously impressive. _Case G_: 1. Child on his
    mother’s shoulder. _Case H_: 1. Child on a toy chariot, full of
    grapes and drawn by dogs. _Case I_: Caricatures. _Case L_: Moulds
    for terra cotta. _Case_ in corner, also _FF_: Fragments from
    Naucratis, the Greek predecessor of Alexandria in Egypt.

    RIGHT WALL: Terra cottas from the Fayoum—stupid and vulgar.

    DOWN THE CENTRE OF ROOM: Four mosaics from Canopus (p. 180); they
    probably decorated the Temple of Serapis there.

    ROOM 19. MISCELLANEOUS.

    IN ENTRANCE: Funerary urn still garlanded with artificial flowers.
    From Chatby. 3rd cent. B.C.

    CENTRE: Mosaic—the best geometrical mosaic in the museum. From
    Chatby.

    IN ANGLES OF ROOM: _Cases A, B, C, D_: Terra cottas from Kom es
    Chogafa. Note in _Case C, shelf b_, 1. Model of seven pots and a big
    jar—like doll’s furniture; and in _Case D_ some unamusing
    grotesques.

    Also in the angles of the octagon: _Cases I, II, III, IV_. Funerary
    furniture from Hadra. (p. 156). In _Case I_ are two beautiful
    objects; a blue enamel vase decorated with faces of Bes, Egyptian
    god of luck; and (_shelf b_, 2): Terra cotta statuette of a boy, who
    clings, laughing, to a term of Dionysus, and holds an apple in his
    hand.

    ROOM 20. CHATBY NECROPOLIS. (p. 164).

    Several painted tombstones. The best are protected by tinted glass,
    and better studied in the water-colour copies hanging above.

    LEFT OF ENTRANCE: 1. Isodora, a lady of Cyrene, with her child. 2. A
    young Macedonian officer, riding; his orderly runs behind holding
    the horse’s tail. Date 4th cent. B.C.—_i.e_. shortly after Alexander
    had founded the city. 10231: Boy and child.

    _Cases A and B_: Funerary furniture. In _Case B_ are some pretty
    terra cottas: 1, 2. Ladies sitting. 7, 8, 9. Schoolgirls at lessons.

    _Pedestal V_ (right wall): Tombstone of young man with a foot-stool
    and pet dog.

    CENTRE OF ROOM: Fine marble group, mutilated, of Dionysus and the
    Faun. Found near the demolished Porte Rosette.

ROOM 21. IBRAHIMIEH NECROPOLIS. (p. 164).

_Case_ in entrance: Wreaths of artificial flowers. Ugly really, but one
is impressed by their being so old. Double flute of ivory.

_Case_ in centre: Mummied birds from Aboukir (p. 180).

_Cases D_ and _F_: From Ibrahimieh. _Case D._ Inscription in Aramaic—one
of the few relics of the early Jewish settlement at Alexandria (p. 62);
some more are on the floor. Date 3rd cent. B.C. _Case F_ (right wall)
Cinerary urns. Groups in painted piaster of the phallic Min (whom the
Greeks identified with Pan), Hercules, Horus, etc.

ROOM 22. CANOPUS. (p. 180).

Disappointing; better work than this tenth rate Hellenistic stuff must
have existed at the great shrine.

LEFT WALL: 1-3:. Inscriptions of historical interest: they mention
Serapis and Isis, the deities of the place, and the Ptolemies
Philadelphus and Euergetes.

BACK WALL: in cases, sculptures and terra cottas.

RIGHT WALL: Stucco-coated columns from the Temple of Serapis; others
have been left in place.

CENTRE: Mosaic from Alexandria.

ROOM 22A. FRESCOES.

RIGHT OF DOOR: Three pagan frescoes, connected with crocodile worship
(_see_ Room 7 and North Garden). From Temple of Petesouchos, Fayoum.
Date 2nd cent. A.D. Thank offerings to the god from Heron Soubathos, an
officer: 1. He stands. 2. He rides.

REST OF ROOM: Christian frescoes of great interest, from crypt
discovered in the desert beyond Lake Mariout. Date 5th cent. A.D. A
staircase led down to a square room. 1 and 2 are from the ceiling of
this room; from its walls come—3 St. Menas standing between camels—4 and
5 the Annunciation. A passage led to a smaller room; on its vault was 6
Head of Christ. In this smaller room were 7 and 8. Out of it opened a
little niche at the end of which was 9 a saint in prayer among the
scenery of paradise.

VERANDAH AND GARDENS. LARGE EXHIBITS.

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VERANDAH: Colossal headless statue of Hercules.

NORTH GARDEN: Left—Gateways and shrine of the _Temple of Petesouchos_,
crocodile god of the Fayoum (_see_ Room 9 for further details). The
first gateway is the entrance Pylon, over which is a Greek inscription
dating the temple to B.C. 137. The wooden door in Room 9 belonged here.
On each side of the gateway are lions. It led to a brick courtyard, in
which was a Nilometer. The court was closed by the second gateway, which
is flanked by sphinxes, and led to a second and similar court. Then
comes the third gate, and, closing the perspective, the shrine. The
shrine has three cavities, in each of which lurked a mummied crocodile
upon a wooden stretcher (_see_ Room 9). In the left cavity is the fresco
of a crocodile; in the central the fresco of a god with a crocodile’s
head between two other deities. Over the cavities are several decorative
friezes—one of snakes. The outside of the shrine is also frescoed to
imitate marble. In front of it was found a wooden chest (Room 9).

AT BACK OF GARDEN: Granite group of Rameses II and his
daughter—headless. From Aboukir. Against the wall behind: colossal green
granite head of Antony as Osiris. From near Nouzha (p. 157). The
companion head of Cleopatra as Isis is in Belgium.

SOUTH GARDEN: Two reconstructed tombs from the Chatby Necropolis (p.
164). The first (in the corner) is remarkable. The sarcophagus imitates
a bed with cushions each end. The chamber where it stands was once
preceded by a long vestibule for the mourners (as in the Anfouchi tombs,
p. 126). The date 3rd. cent. B.C. The second tomb has a shell vault
niche (like Kom es Chogafa, p. 148).

                  *       *       *       *       *

The Rue Rosette continues and at last issues from between houses. Here,
ever since its foundation, the city has ended; in Ptolemaic times the
Gate of the Sun or Canopic Gate stood here, in Arab times the Rosetta
Gate. The Public Gardens (left and right) follow the line of the Arab
walls (see p. 81 and Section IV). The tramway to Nouzha crosses the
route. The road continues under another name to Sidi Gaber (Section V),
thence to Ramleh, and to Aboukir (Section VII). It is a good road and
well planted; but terribly straight, like all roads that the Ancients
have planned.




                              SECTION II.

                                -------

                     FROM THE SQUARE TO RAS-EL-TIN.


ROUTE:—By the Rue de France and Rue Ras-el-Tin to Ras-el-Tin promontory;
returning to the Square by Anfouchi Bay and the Eastern Harbour—the
“Circular” Tram (Green Triangle) runs along the Quays.

CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—Terbana and Chorbagi Mosques; Mosque of Abou
el Abbas; Anfouchi Catacombs; Ras-el-Tin Palace; Prehistoric Harbour;
Fort Kait Bey; New Quays.

We start from the north-west corner of the Square. The Rue de France
traverses the “Turkish Town” (p. 84), which was built in the 17th and
18th cents. on the spit of land that had accreted round the ruined
Ptolemaic dyke (p. 10). Its bazaars and Mosques are on a small scale,
for the city was then at her feeblest. But the district is picturesque
and, especially at evening, full of gentle charm. The best way of seeing
it is to wander aimlessly about.

In the Rue de France:—Right: Rue Pirona. Built into the wall at its
entrance are fragments of Egyptian sculpture, the lion-headed goddess
Sekhet, &c. The road opens into a picturesque little square which
contains a former Native Tribunal, and a building (No. 4) that has a
carved gateway and a tranquil court yard with antique columns.

In the roads to the left of the Rue de France are some Mosques:—

    _Mosque of Sheikh Ibrahim Pacha_, off the south-west corner of the
    Square; big ugly building with red and yellow minaret.

    _Chorbagi Mosque_, in the Rue el Midan. Well worth a visit.
    Date—1757. Plan—similar to the Terbana (_see_ below). Exterior
    spoilt by restoration, but the door from the vestibule into the
    mosque proper has over it a trefoil arch full of brilliant tiles; in
    the centre of the arch is a miniature praying niche (mihrab).—The
    Interior, though mean architecturally, retains its magnificent Tile
    Decoration almost intact. The tiles are grouped round the walls in
    great panels, the design being sometimes geometrical and sometimes a
    pot of flowers. Between the panels are bands of contrasting tiles.
    Colours:—in the panels, yellow, green, and a deep cornflower-blue
    predominate; in the bands, china-blue and white. A few of the panels
    are of polished conglomerate stone. The Prayer Niche—flanked by two
    bizarre twisted columns—has the pot of flowers design. The door of
    the pulpit is handsome; it has duplicated Cufic inscriptions, which
    on the right read from right to left, as is usual, and on the left
    are reversed for the sake of symmetry: a good instance of the
    decorative tendency of Arab Art. Externally the Mosque is flanked by
    arcades; one overlooks the street and is used by the Muezzin, since
    there is no minaret; the other looks into a courtyard of stilted
    arches.

    _Mosque of Abou Ali._ (Go nearly to the end of the long Rue Bab el
    Akdar; thence, right, into Rue Masguid Ali Bey Guenenah; thence,
    right again). There is nothing to see in this humble little Mosque,
    but it is said to be the oldest in the city. In it are the figures
    677, which, if they record the date A.H., would mean 1278 A.D. The
    natives say that it once stood at the edge of the sea, so that the
    faithful made their ablutions with salt water before praying. The
    tradition may be correct, for the old line of the coast lay here.
    (_see_ map p. 98). The building in its present appearance cannot be
    earlier than the 18th cent.; in it, perched on the summit of the
    pulpit, is the model of a boat.

Continuing from the Rue de France we see ahead the white mass of the
_Terbana Mosque_.

    Well worth visiting, in spite of modern plaster and paint.
    Date—1684. The little doorway on the street is in the “Delta”
    style—bricks painted black and red, with occasional courses of wood
    between them and Cufic inscriptions above: “There is no God but
    God,” and “Mohammed is the Prophet of God”; better examples of the
    style at Rosetta (p. 185). The rest of the ground floor is occupied
    by shops. At the top of the stairs an interesting scene unfolds. To
    the left are two great antique granite columns with Corinthian
    capitals, and through them an open air terrace with an iron trellis
    and barred windows. To the right is the Vestibule of the Mosque,
    once very beautiful; two thirds of the entrance wall are still
    covered with tiles, designed like those in the Chorbagi, and over
    the door is the inscription “Built in 1097 A.H. by Haj Ibrahim
    Terbana,” surmounted by a trefoil arch. More antique columns. The
    Interior is a rectangle, divided up by eight columns, disfigured but
    antique. Good painted ceiling, best seen from the western gallery.
    The Prayer Niche is finely tiled, as is the wall to its right; the
    large tiles with white daisies on them are inferior modern work.
    Lamentable chandeliers.—There is an external gallery with antique
    columns. The Minaret rises above the entrance landing; its topmost
    gallery is tiled.

The main route now takes the name Rue Ras-el-Tin. Here once began the
southern shore of the Island of Pharos. Consequently ancient remains
occur in situ.

Right: Rue Sidi Abou el Abbas leads to the square of that name—the most
considerable in the Turkish Town; here, by evening light, one sometimes
has the illusion of oriental romance; here (1922) is the rallying point
of the Nationalist demonstrations. The road, just before it enters the
square, crosses the site of a temple to Isis Pharia who watched over the
lighthouse. (see coin in Museum, Room 2).

Dominating the square is the great white _Mosque of Abou el Abbas
Moursi_, built 1767 by Algerians, some of whom still live in the
neighbourhood; the tomb of the saint (d. 1288) is under a low dome; the
other side of the Mosque (reached by a winding passage to the right) has
an unrestored brick entrance in the “Delta” style, with pendentives,
tiles, and a Cufic inscription.—At the end of the Square:—little _Mosque
of Sidi Daoud_, with tomb of the saint, from whose precinct two tall
palm trees rise.—Just off south side of square is a typical street tomb
(Sidi Abou el Fath), enclosed in its green lattice; of the houses close
to it No. 31 has good carved “Mashrabieh” work, No. 33 a carved lintel,
with door posts of alternate courses of limestone and wood. All this
tangle of lanes preserves the atmosphere of the 18th cent. East. Between
the Abou el Abbas Mosque and the sea is a large modern Mosque—the
Bouseiri—where the Sultan usually makes his Friday prayer; a little up
the street is a stone fragment, covered with hieroglyphs, and now used
upside down as a seat.

The Rue Ras-el-Tin is now joined by the “Circular” tram line. To the
right is a large piece of waste ground. In the corner of this, close to
the road, are some dilapidated glass roofs; these protect the Anfouchi
Tombs; the custodian lives close by.




                          THE ANFOUCHI TOMBS.


[Illustration: THE ANFOUCHI TOMBS
I. Vestibule with scribblings
II. Vestibule with chessboard decorations
III. Vestibule with benches
IV. Vestibule with Roman additions]


Though inferior to the Kom es Chougafa Catacombs, (p. 148), these tomb
groups are interesting for their decoration scheme. Their entrances
adjoin, their plan is similar:—a staircase, cut through the limestone,
leads down to a square hall out of which the tomb-chambers open. The
decoration is of stucco painted to imitate marble blocks and tiles. It
is shoddy, and sometimes recalls the imitation wall papers of Victorian
England. Archaeologists know it as the First Pompeian style.
Date:—Ptolemaic with Roman additions. Name of occupants: unknown.

    RIGHT-HAND TOMB GROUP. (_see_ plan p. 127).

    At the first turn of the stairs, protected by a cloth, is a good
    picture. Subject:—Purification of the Dead by water (?); Horus, with
    a falcon’s head, points with one hand to the land of death, and with
    the other tries to draw the dead man towards it; Osiris holds out a
    lustral vase; Isis is behind.—At the second turn of the stairs is
    another picture, half destroyed;—Osiris sits on a throne as king of
    the Dead with the dog-god Anubis behind him; before him, just
    discernable, stands Horus introducing the dead man.

    Thus the staircase reminded visitors of the difficulties through
    which the dead must pass, and honoured Osiris, Isis, and their son
    Horus—a trinity whose worship was popular in Ptolemaic times and
    often connected with the worship of Serapis. The walls imitate
    alabaster &c.; on the vault, geometric designs.

    The Hall is open to the air. It gives access to two tomb chambers,
    each of which has a vestibule for mourners. That to the right (i) is
    undecorated, but the scribblings on the vestibule walls are most
    amusing; they were made over 2,000 years ago by a visitor or
    workman, and help us to reconstruct the life of the Greco-Egyptian
    city. The inscriptions are in Greek. On the left wall Diodorus has
    immortalised Antiphiles, his friend. Further on is a sailing ship.
    Right wall, a battle ship with a turret for fighting, such as might
    have accompanied Cleopatra to Actium.

    The vestibule in front (ii) is quite charming. It was decorated in
    the same style as the staircase—traces of this remain on the inside
    of its entrance wall—but soon after a fresh coat of stucco was
    applied, and painted like the first to imitate marble, but in better
    taste. Below, is a dado of “alabaster” above it an effective design
    of black and white squares arranged chess board fashion and divided
    by alabaster bands. In the chess board are mythological scenes, now
    defaced. The ceiling, being purely geometric, probably belongs to
    the earlier scheme.

    At the end of the vestibule is the entrance to the tomb chamber,
    with the disc of the Sun (Ra) carved above it, and, on either side,
    little sleeping sphinxes upon pedestals. A door once closed it;
    holes for the bolt remain. The tomb chamber itself is decorated in
    the same pretty style. An altar once stood in the middle. In the
    back wall is a tiny shrine, closing the vista. The general effect is
    good, but dainty rather than solemn; the terrors of ancient Egypt
    are on the wane.

    LEFT HAND TOMB GROUP.

    The vestibule in front, as one enters the Hall, is very long, and
    low benches on which the mourners sat run up it on each side. (iii).
    In the tomb chamber is an enormous sarcophagus of rose coloured
    granite from Assouan.

    The vestibule and tomb chamber to the left (iv) were excavated and
    decorated on the usual plan. But in the Roman period they were much
    pulled about, and brick work introduced, together with three new
    sarcophagi.

                  *       *       *       *       *

There are traces of other tombs over the waste ground, which covers the
cemetery of the ancient Island of Pharos. We are now in the centre of
the Island, and about to visit its western extremity.

Straight ahead, up a rise, is _Ras-el-Tin Palace_, the summer residence
of the Sultan, who makes his state entry every June. It was built by
Mohammed Ali (p. 88), who had here the stormy interview with Sir Charles
Napier, that ended his loftier ambitions (p. 89); Ismail restored it;
Tewfik was here during some of the troubles of 1882 (p. 95). It is not
ugly, as palaces go; the grandiose classical portico is rather
impressive. To the right are the barracks.

The peninsula narrows. The road leads on to the Yacht Club (left), and
terminates at the Military Hospital which is beautifully situated on the
rocky point of Ras-el-Tin (the “Cape of Figs”); splendid views of the
Western Harbour and the sea; a Temple of Neptune once stood here, and
there are ruins of tombs all along the northern shore. A modern
lighthouse stands in the Hospital enclosure, and marks the entrance to
the harbour. The Breakwater (constructed 1870-74) starts below, makes
towards the isolated rock of Abou Bakr, then bends to the left. Over the
water are the island of Marabout and the headland of Agame, which are
part of the same limestone chain as Ras-el-Tin, and connected with it by
submarine reefs.

The sea west and north of the point is full of remains of the
Prehistoric Harbour.




                          PREHISTORIC HARBOUR.


    For details of this important and mysterious work see “Les Ports
    submergés de l’ancienne Isle de Pharos” by M. Jondet, the
    discoverer. Possibly it may be the harbour alluded to in the Odyssey
    (_see_ p. 6), but no historian mentions it. Theosophists, with more
    zeal than probability, have annexed it to the vanished civilisation
    of Atlantis; M. Jondet inclines to the theory that it may be
    Minoan—built by the maritime power of Crete. If Egyptian in origin,
    perhaps the work of Rameses II (B.C. 1300); statues of his reign
    have been found on Rhakotis (p. 7), and we know that he was attacked
    by “peoples of the West,” and built defences against them. It cannot
    be as late as Alexander the Great or we should have records. It is
    the oldest work in the district and also the most romantic, for to
    its antiquity is added the mystery of the sea.

    Long and narrow, the Harbour stretched from the rock of Abou Bakr on
    the west to an eastern barrier that touched the shore beyond the
    Tour de la Mission d’Egypt. These two points are joined up by a
    series of breakwaters on the north. The entrance was from an
    unexpected direction, the south. Having rounded Abou Bakr, ships
    turned north under the Ras-el-Tin promontory, where there is deep
    water. To their left were solid quays, stretching to Abou Bakr, and
    recently utilised in the foundation of the modern breakwater. To
    their right was another quay. Having entered, they were well in the
    middle of the main harbour, with a subsidiary harbour to the north.

The visit to the Harbour is best made by boat, since most of the remains
now lie from 4 to 25 feet under the sea. They have, like all the coast
line, subsided, because the Nile deposits on which they stand are apt to
compress, and even to slide towards deeper water. They are built of
limestone blocks from the quarries of Mex and Dekhela, but the
construction, necessarily simple, gives no hint as to nationality or
date. The modern breakwater, being built across the entrance, makes the
scheme rather difficult to follow. (_see_ Plan p. 131.).


[Illustration: THE PREHISTORIC HARBOUR
_Modern work shown thus_ .......
_Ancient work shown thus_ ________]


The Small Quay (_a_) is in perfect condition, and not four feet under
water. Length: 70 yards, breadth, 15; the surface curves slightly
towards the south. The blocks, measuring about a yard each, are cut to
fit one another roughly, small stones filling up the joints. The
Ras-el-Tin jetty crosses the end of this Quay; the point of intersection
is near the red hut on the jetty.—At the north end of the Quay is an
extension (_b_) that protected the harbour entrance.

Further north, well inside the harbour, is an islet (_c_) covered with
remains. Some are tombs, and of later date; submerged, are the
foundations of a rectangular building (30 yds. by 15) reached on the
south by steps, and connected by little channels with the sea on the
north. This islet may have contained the harbour offices.

From the modern breakwater the Great Quays (_d_) show here and there as
ochreous lines below the waves. They are 700 yds. long, and constructed
like the Small Quay, but from larger stones. They connect with the rock
of Abou Bakr (_e_), the western bastion of the Prehistoric Harbour; it
is a solid mass over 200 yds. square; most is on the sea level, but a
part juts up; it is marked all over with foundation cuts and the remains
of masonry. West of Abou Bakr is a double breakwater (_f_) further
protecting the works from the sea and the prevalent wind; and on it
hinges the huge northern breakwater (_g_) also double in parts, which
runs with interruptions till it reaches the eastern barrier (_h_). The
rock is named after the first Caliph of Islam.

The outer harbour (_i_) has not yet been fully explored.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Having returned as far as Ras-el-Tin Palace, we bear to the left, and
follow the tram line along the shore of Anfouchi Bay. The Bay is very
shallow and the entrance is protected by reefs. Pirates used it once.
Native boat builders work along its beach and are pleasant to watch. In
the corner is Anfouchi Pier, with a bathing establishment; beyond, on a
small promontory, stands all that is left of Fort Adda; Arabi had his
powder stored here in 1882, and the English blew it up (p. 94). Now the
tram turns a sharp corner, and a second Fort swings into view—Fort Kait
Bey.




                     FORT KAIT BEY (THE “PHAROS”).


This battered and neglected little peninsula is perhaps the most
interesting spot in Alexandria, for here, rising to an incredible
height, once stood the Pharos Lighthouse, the wonder of the world.
Contrary to general belief, some fragments of the Pharos still remain.
But before visiting them and the Arab fort in which they are imbedded,
some knowledge of history is desirable. The fortunes of the peninsula
were complicated, and the labours of scholars have only lately made them
clear.

    HISTORY.

    (1). THE ORIGINAL BUILDING. (_see_ also 16).

    The lighthouse took its name from Pharos Island (hence the French
    “phare” and the Italian “faro”). No doubt it entered into Alexander
    the Great’s scheme for his maritime capital, but the work was not
    done till the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus. Probable date of
    dedication: B.C. 279, when the king held a festival to commemorate
    his parents. Architect: Sostratus, an Asiatic Greek. The sensation
    it caused was tremendous. It appealed both to the sense of beauty
    and to the taste for science—an appeal typical of the age. Poets and
    engineers combined to praise it. Just as the Parthenon had been
    identified with Athens and St. Peter’s was to be identified with
    Rome, so, to the imagination of contemporaries, the Pharos became
    Alexandria and Alexandria became the Pharos. Never, in the history
    of architecture, has a secular building been thus worshipped and
    taken on a spiritual life of its own. It beaconed to the
    imagination, not only to ships at sea, and long after its light was
    extinguished memories of it glowed in the minds of men.

    It stood in a colonnaded court. (Plan II p. 135). There were four
    stories. (Plan I, Fig. i). The square bottom storey was pierced with
    many windows and contained the rooms, estimated at 300, where the
    mechanics and attendants were housed. There was a spiral
    ascent—probably a double spiral—and in the centre there may have
    been hydraulic machinery for raising fuel to the top; otherwise we
    must imagine a procession of donkeys who cease not night and day to
    go up and down the spirals with loads of wood on their backs. The
    storey ended in a square platform and a cornice and figures of
    Tritons. Here too, in great letters of lead, was the Greek
    inscription; “Sostratus of Cnidos, son of Dexiphanes: to the Saviour
    Gods: for sailors”—an inscription which, despite its simplicity,
    bore a double meaning. The “Saviour Gods” are of course Castor and
    Pollux who protect mariners, but a courtly observer could refer them
    to Ptolemy Soter and Berenice, whose worship their son was
    promoting.


[Illustration: KAIT BEY PLAN I

[Illustration: KAIT BEY PLAN II]


    The second storey was octagonal and entirely filled by the spiral
    ascent. Above that was the circular third story, and above that the
    lantern. The lighting arrangements are uncertain. Visitors speak of
    a mysterious “mirror” on the summit, which was even more wonderful
    than the building itself. What was this “mirror”? Was it a polished
    steel reflector for the fire at night or for heliography by day?
    Some accounts describe it as made of finely wrought glass or
    transparent stone, and declare that a man sitting under it could see
    ships at sea that were invisible to the naked eye. A telescope? Is
    it possible that the great Alexandrian school of mathematics
    discovered the lens, and that their discovery was lost and forgotten
    when the Pharos fell? It is possible. It is certain that the
    lighthouse was fitted with every scientific improvement known to the
    age, that the antique world never surpassed it, and that the
    mediaeval world regarded it as the work of Jinns.

    Standing on the lantern was a statue of Poseidon. This terminated
    the tower, whose complete height certainly exceeded 400 feet and
    possibly touched 500.


    (2) HISTORY OF THE BUILDING.

    We must now follow this masterpiece of engineering into ages of myth
    and oblivion. It retained its form and functions unimpaired up to
    the Arab Conquest (A.D. 641). The first, and irreparable, disaster
    was the fall of the lantern (about 700), entailing the loss of
    scientific apparatus that could not be replaced. There is a legend
    that the disaster was planned by the Byzantine Emperor, who could
    not attack Egypt owing to the magic “Mirror,” which detected or
    destroyed his ships. He sent an agent who gained the Caliph’s
    confidence and told him that beneath the Pharos the treasure of
    Alexander the Great lay buried. The Caliph commenced demolition, and
    before the inhabitants of Alexandria, who knew better, could
    intervene, the two upper stories had fallen into the sea. Henceforth
    the Pharos is only a stump with a bonfire on the top.

    There were restorations under Ibn Touloun (880), and also about 980,
    but they were unsubstantial additions to the Octagon which the wind
    could blow away. Structural repairs were neglected, and about 1100
    the second disaster occurred—the fall of the Octagon itself through
    an earthquake. The square bottom story survived, but only as a
    watchtower on the top of which was run up a small square Mosque.
    (_see_ Plan I, Fig. ii, which illustrates this state of the Pharos.
    The level of the ground has risen owing to the debris from the
    octagon, and the lower story has been buttressed). Then came the
    final earthquake (14th cent.) and the slow dissolution was over.

        Though unable to preserve the Pharos the Arabs admired it, and
        speak, with their love of the marvellous, of a statue on it
        whose finger followed the diurnal course of the sun, of a second
        statue who gave out with varying and melodious voices the
        various hours of the day, and of a third who shouted an alarm as
        soon as a hostile flotilla set sail,. The first two statues may
        have existed; the Alexandrians loved such toys. And there is an
        element of truth in another Arab legend—that the building rested
        upon a “glass crab.” Some vitrious composition probably did form
        the foundation, and we know that “Cleopatra’s Needle” actually
        did rest on crabs of metal (p. 162); the oriental mind has
        confused the two monuments. The legend culminates in the visit
        to the Pharos of a cavalcade of horsemen who lose their way in
        the 300 rooms, and inadvertently riding into a crack in the
        glass crab’s back fall into the sea! But sometimes the
        lighthouse sheltered pleasanter adventures. The poet El Deraoui,
        for example, writes:

              A lofty platform guides the voyager by night, guides
            him with its light when the darkness of evening falls.

              Thither have I borne a garment of perfect pleasure
            among my friends, a garment adorned with the memory of
            beloved companions.

              On its height a dome enshadowed me, and thence I saw
            my friends like stars.

              I thought that the sea below me was a cloud, and that
            I had set up my tent in the midst of the heavens.

        Moreover “El Manarah,” as the Arabs called it, gave the name to,
        and became the model for, the “minaret.” There is no minaret in
        Alexandria that closely follows the Pharos, but at Cairo (e.g.
        at the Tombs of the Mamelukes) one can still see the square
        bottom story, the Octagon, the Round and the Summit that exactly
        reproduce the four-stage design of Sostratus.


        (3). FORT KAIT BEY.

        For a hundred years ruins cumbered the peninsula. Then (1480)
        the Mameluke Sultan Kait Bey fortified it as part of his coast
        defence against the Turks, who had taken Constantinople and were
        threatening Egypt. (p. 81). Kait Bey is a great figure at Cairo,
        where mosques commemorate his glorious reign. Here he only
        builds a fort, but like all his work it is architecturally fine,
        and even in decay its outlines are harmonious. The scheme was a
        pentagon (Plan II) and in the enclosed area, on the exact site
        of the Pharos, stood a square castle or keep with a mosque
        embedded in it. (Plan I, Fig. iii, which shows the castle before
        it was ruined, the minaret sticking up inside it). The Turks
        effected their conquest in 1517, and when their power in its
        turn declined, Mohammed Ali (1805-1848) modernised the defences.
        No visitors were admitted, and the Fort gained the reputation of
        an impregnable and mysterious place. Its career ended with the
        English bombardment of 1882. Though it did not suffer as much as
        its neighbour Fort Adda, damage enough was done. The castle was
        shattered, the minaret snapped, and the desolation and squalor
        re-established that brood there to-day.

                  *       *       *       *       *

    We can now examine the existing remains. (_See_ Plans I & II pp. 134
    & 135).

    The connecting spit of land only formed in the 9th cent. Previously
    there was shallow water, spanned by a bridge. Right, as we approach,
    is anchorage for an Italian fishing fleet; the men come from Bari in
    the Adriatic.—The road leads by the side of the fort to the new
    breakwater, built to protect the Eastern Harbour and the Sea wall.
    The Breakwater is a noble work, and it is a pity it is approached
    through a gateway that suggests an English provincial Jail; the
    embellishments of modern Alexandria are unduly lugubrious.

    The blocked up _Gateway_ to the Fort is flanked by round towers;
    inside it are several rooms with 15th cent. vaulting.—To its left,
    built into the masonry of Kait Bey’s wall or lying on the beach, are
    about thirty _broken columns_ of red Assouan granite; also two or
    three pieces of fine speckled granite and one piece of marble. These
    are survivals from the Pharos, and may have stood in the colonnade
    of its surrounding court; the sea wall of that court probably
    diverged here from the line of Kait Bey’s wall; there are traces of
    cutting among the rocks.

    The interior of the Fort (best entered from the right) is now a bare
    enclosure with a few coast-guard huts. The isolated lump of building
    at the end is the remains of Kait Bey’s _Castle_, occupying the
    ground plan of the Pharos and utilising in part its foundations.
    Some of these foundations can be seen in the passage immediately to
    the right of the Castle. The orientation of the Castle and the
    Pharos was not exactly the same, since the Castle had to be adjusted
    to the points of the compass on account of the mosque that it
    contained.—The modern buildings to the right of the passage also
    rest on old foundations; it is thought that here stood the
    reservoir, filled with fresh water from the mainland and that on the
    other side (left of present Castle) stood another edifice with the
    mechanical statues to balance the design. But this is all
    conjecture.

    The _Mosque_ in the Castle is notable for two reasons:
    architecturally it is the oldest in the city, and in style it is
    essentially Cairene. It was built by the central government in the
    course of their coast defence scheme, and so does not resemble the
    ordinary mosque of the Delta. The entrance, with its five monoliths
    of Assouan granite, taken from the Pharos, is almost druidical in
    effect, but the arch above them and the flanking towers faintly
    recall the glories of Kait Bey’s work at Cairo. In the vestibule are
    remains of stucco on the ceiling and marble on the floor.—The actual
    Mosque is of the “school” type—a square with an arched recess
    opening out of each side, each recess being assigned to one of the
    four orthodox sects of Islam; the Mosque of Sultan Hassan at Cairo
    is a famous example of this type. The square, and the step leading
    up to each recess are inlaid with marble. Light enters through
    carved woodwork above.

    Over the Mosque are vaulted rooms. From the summit of the mass is a
    _View_ of Alexandria, not beautiful but instructive. From right to
    left are:—Fort Adda, Ras-el-Tin lighthouse (background); minarets of
    Abou el Abbas and Bouseiri Mosques (foreground); Kom-el-Nadur Fort;
    Terbana Mosque (foreground); Pompey’s Pillar (back); Kom-el-Dik
    Fort; the long line of Eastern suburbs; beyond them the distant
    minaret of Sidi Bishr; the coast ends in the wooded promontory of
    Montazah. Close beneath is the modern Breakwater stretching towards
    the opposing promontory of Silsileh; and left, awash with waves, the
    Diamond Rock.—And now let the visitor (if the effort is not beyond
    him) elevate himself 400 feet higher into the air. Let him replace
    the Ras-el-Tin lighthouse by a Temple to Poseidon; let him delete
    the mosques and the ground they stand on, and imagine in their place
    an expanse of water crossed by a Dyke; let him add to “Pompey’s
    Pillar” the Temple of Serapis and Isis and the vast buttressed walls
    of the Library; let him turn Kom-el-Dik into a gorgeous and
    fantastic park, with the Tomb of Alexander at its feet; and the
    Eastern Suburbs into gardens; and finally let him suppose that it is
    not Silsileh that stretches towards him but the peak of the
    Ptolemaic Palace, sheltering to its right the ships of the royal
    fleet and flanked on the landward side by the tiers of the theatre
    and the groves of the Mouseion.—Then he may have some conception of
    what Ancient Alexandria looked like from the summit of the
    Pharos—what she looked like when the Arabs entered in the autumn of
    641.

    Beneath the Batteries on the north of the Fort, and almost level
    with the beach, is a long gallery in which lie some shells that were
    fired by the English in 1882.

                  *       *       *       *       *

    The tram now follows the curve of the _Eastern Harbour_, a
    beautifully shaped basin. It was the main harbour of the ancients,
    but Mohammed Ali when he planned the modern city, developed the
    Western instead (p. 91). There is a sea wall in two stages, to break
    the waves which dash right on to the road in rough weather; and
    there is a very fine promenade—the New Quays—which stretches all the
    way from Kait Bey to Silsileh. A walk along it can be delightful,
    though occasionally marred by bad smells.—We pass, right, the
    Bouseiri Mosque (_see_ above) and finally come to the French
    Gardens, that connect with the Square, whence we started.

    Left of the French Gardens are: the French Consulate—an isolated
    building; the General Post Office—entered from the road behind; and
    the Church of St. Andrews—Church of Scotland. To the right, down Rue
    de l’Eglise Maronite, is the Maronite Church, an inoffensive
    building; (for the Maronites _see_ pp. 77, 213).




                              SECTION III.

                                -------

                 FROM THE SQUARE TO THE SOUTHERN QUARTERS.




    ROUTE:—By the Place St. Catherine and Pompey’s Pillar to the
    Mahmoudieh Canal, taking the Karmous Tram (Green Lozenge). The
    Ragheb Pasha Tram (Red Crescent) and the Moharrem Bey tram (Red
    Circle) also go from the Square to the Canal. There is also the
    “Circular” Tram (Green Triangle) which crosses the three lines just
    mentioned, on its course from Cairo Railway Station to the Docks.
    There is a carriage road along the Canal.

    CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—Pompey’s Pillar, Kom es Chogafa Catacombs,
    the Canal.

    The Southern Quarters are neither smart nor picturesque. But they
    include the site of Rhakotis, the nucleus of ancient Alexandria, and
    preserve some remarkable antiquities (_see_ pp. 7, 18). Here too are
    the churches and schools of the various religious and political
    bodies (_see_ p. 211).

    We start from the south side of the Square, and immediately reach
    the _Place St. Catherine_, a triangular green. Here is the
    traditional site of St. Catherine’s martyrdom, whence she was
    transported to Mount Sinai by angels. But the legend only dates from
    the 9th cent. and it is unlikely that the saint ever existed (_see_
    p. 46). Franciscans settled here in the 15th cent. and built a
    church that has disappeared. In 1832 Mohammed Ali granted land to
    the Roman Catholics, and the present _Cathedral Church of St.
    Catherine_ was begun. It fell down while it was being put up, but
    undeterred by the omen the builders persisted, and here is the
    result. Gaunt without and tawdry within, the Cathedral makes no
    attempt to commemorate the exquisite legend round which so much that
    is beautiful has gathered in the West; St. Catherine of Alexandria
    is without grace in her own city. The approach to the church has
    however a certain ecclesiastic calm.—Behind (entered from Rue Sidi
    el Metwalli) is the Catholic Archbishop’s Palace; the wayside tomb
    of the Mohammedan Saint Sidi el Metwalli, a prior arrival, abuts
    into his Grace’s garden.

    Left of the Cathedral is another in equally bad taste—the Cathedral
    of the Greek Community (Greek Orthodox) dedicated to the
    Annunciation. The Schools of the Community are close to it.

    Left, after leaving the Place St. Catherine:—Rue Sidi el Metwalli,
    following the line of the ancient Canopic Way; it leads past the
    _Attarine Mosque_, which is worth looking at. In the past, buildings
    of greater importance stood on this commanding site. Here was a
    church to St. Athanasius, dedicated soon after his death (4th
    cent.). In the Arab Conquest (7th cent.) the church was adapted into
    a great mosque, square in shape like the Mosque of Ibn Touloun at
    Cairo, and stretching some way to the north of the present building;
    travellers mistook it for the tomb or the palace of Alexander the
    Great. In it stood an ancient sarcophagus, weighing nearly seven
    tons. The English, informed that Alexander had once lain here, took
    the sarcophagus away when they occupied Alexandria in 1801. (_see_
    p. 88). The French protested, and the sheikhs of the Mosque, deeply
    moved, came down to the boat to bid the relic farewell. The
    sarcophagus is now in the British Museum, and has proved to belong
    to the native Pharaoh Nekht Heru Hebt. B.C. 378.—The present Mosque
    is wedge shaped with a minaret at the point; a good little specimen
    of modern Mohammedan architecture. It has a second facade in the Rue
    Attarine, (Scent Bazaar) whence its name. Inside is the Tomb of Said
    Mohammed (13th cent.), a friend of Abou el Abbas (p. 126).—Beyond it
    the road becomes the Rue Rosette (_see_ Section I); right is the
    American Mission Church and the Cairo Station.

    Right after leaving the Place:—district inhabited by the Armenian
    community (_see_ p. 212). Their church is simple and rather
    attractive, and has the projecting western vestibule characteristic
    of Armenian architecture, e.g. of the Metropolitan Cathedral of
    Etchmiadzine. In the grave yard are monuments of Nubar Pasha by
    Puech (_see_ p. 155), and of Takvor Pasha. In the grounds of the
    school, a black basalt sphinx.

    Straight ahead after leaving the Place: is the Rue Abou el Dardaa.
    In a turning out of it to the right (Rue Prince Moneim) in the
    grounds of a florist named Mousny, are some remains of the _Old
    Protestant Cemetery_.—The burials are of a later date than those at
    St. Saba (p. 106). The most interesting is the Tomb of Henry Salt.
    Salt, a vigorous but rather shady Englishman with an artistic
    temperament, first came to these parts in 1809, when he was sent on
    a mission to Abyssinia. Six years later he became Consul General and
    fell in with the financial plans of Mohammed Ali (p. 90), and
    acquiesced in his illegal monopolies. He was an ardent archaeologist
    of the commercial type and got concessions for excavating in Upper
    Egypt, offering the results, at exorbitant rates, to the British
    Museum. After much haggling the Museum bought his collection in
    1823. He died near Alexandria in 1827. The quaint inscription on his
    tomb says:—

        His ready genius explored and elucidated the Hieroglypics (sic)
        and other antiquities of this country. His faithful and rapid
        pencil and the nervous originality of his untutored senses
        conveyed to the world vivid ideas of the scenes that had
        delighted himself.

    Some of the tombs are hidden among plants and ferns. The Cemetery
    was once much larger; the road has cut through it.

    At the end of the Rue Abou el Dardaa, where the tram turns, is the
    _Mosque of Amr_. Here probably stood the Mosque of Mercy which the
    conqueror Amr ordered to be built where he had sheathed his sword
    after the recapture of the city in 643 (_see_ p. 57).

    We turn right for a few yards, along a road that follows the line of
    the vanished Arab Walls (p. 81). Then to the left by the big Italian
    schools. The tram has now entered the ancient district of Rhakotis.




              “POMPEY’S PILLAR” and the TEMPLE OF SERAPIS.


    [Illustration: Pompey’s Pillar etc.]


    As often happens in Alexandria, history and archaeology fail to
    support one another. Ancient writers do not mention “Pompey’s
    Pillar,” but they tell us a great deal about the buildings that
    stood in its neighbourhood and have now disappeared. This shapeless
    hill was from early times covered with temples and houses. Long
    before Alexander came it was the citadel of Rhakotis (p. 7). Osiris
    was worshipped here. Then with Ptolemy Soter it leaps into fame.
    Osiris is modified into Serapis (p. 18), and the hill, encased in
    great bastions of masonry was built up into an acropolis on whose
    summit rose the God’s temple. Under Cleopatra it gained additional
    splendour. The great library of Alexandria had been burnt in the
    Caesarian war, and the queen began a new collection which she
    attached to the Serapeum. Here for four hundred years was the most
    learned spot on the earth. The Christians wiped it out. In 391 the
    Patriarch Theophilus (p. 50) led a mob against the temple, sacked
    it, and broke the statue of the God. It is impossible that the books
    should not have perished at the same time: they were arranged in the
    cloisters that surrounded the temple (_see_ below) so that the mob
    had to pass them to reach its central prey. The monks now swarmed
    over the hill and built a church to St. John the Baptist in the
    gutted shrine. Here were the head quarters of Theophilus’ nephew,
    Cyril (p. 51) and hence his supporters issued to murder Hypatia at
    the other end of the town (415). With the invasion of the Arabs the
    darkness increases. The library had already disappeared (the legend
    accusing them of burning it has the flimsiest foundations), but they
    did plenty of harm in other ways: one of the Arab governors threw a
    quantity of columns into the sea in the hope of obstructing a
    hostile fleet. When the Crusaders visited Egypt (15th cent.) the
    original scheme of the Acropolis had vanished, and their attention
    was caught by this solitary pillar. The Crusaders were no scholars
    but they had heard of Pompey, so they called the pillar after him,
    and said that his head was enclosed in a ball on the top. (_see_
    Belon’s View p. 83). The error has been perpetuated and the visitor
    must remember, firstly that the pillar has nothing to do with Pompey
    and secondly that it is a subordinate monument that the accident of
    time has preserved: it is a part and a small one of the splendours
    of the Temple of Serapis.

    The following remains can be visited (_see_ Plan 144).

    (i). _“Pompey’s Pillar.”_ 84 feet high and about 7 thick; made of
    red granite from Assouan. An imposing but ungraceful object.
    Architecture has evolved nothing more absurd than the monumental
    column; there is no reason that it should ever stop nor much that it
    should begin, and this specimen is not even well proportioned. The
    substructure is interesting. It is made up of blocks that have been
    taken from older buildings. On the eastern face (nearest turnstile)
    is a block of green granite with an inscription in Greek in honour
    of Arsinoe, the sister and wife of Ptolemy Philadelphus (p. 14). On
    the opposite face (upside down in a recess) is the figure and
    hieroglyph of Seti I (B.C. 1350), suggesting the great age of the
    settlement on Rhakotis.

    Why and when was the pillar put up?

    Probably to the Emperor Diocletian, about A.D. 297. There is a four
    line Greek inscription to him on the granite base on the western
    side, about 10 feet up. It is illegible and indeed invisible from
    the ground. Generations of scholars have worked at it with the
    following result:—

        “To the most just Emperor, the tutelary God of Alexandria,
        Diocletian the invincible: Postumus, prefect of Egypt.”

    The formidable Emperor (p. 46) had crushed a rebellion here and was
    a god to be propitiated; the pillar, erected in the precincts of
    Serapis, would celebrate his power and clemency and presumably bore
    his statue on the top.—There is another theory: that the column was
    dedicated after the triumph of the Christians in 391 and glorifies
    the new religion; if this is so it must itself have previously been
    pagan, for by this date the Alexandrians had not the means or the
    power to erect a new monument of such a size.

    (ii). _The Temple of Serapis._ West of the Pillar, reached by a
    staircase, are long subterranean galleries, excavated in the rock
    and lined with limestone. These were probably part of the
    Serapeum—basements of some sort—and enthusiastic visitors have even
    identified them with the library where the books were kept; in them
    are some small semi-circular niches of unknown use. Some marble
    columns stand on the ground above.—South of the Pillar, near the
    Sphinxes, are more passages, lined with cement; these too may have
    been part of the temple. All is conjectural, and the plan of the
    Serapeum, as we gather it from classical writers, can in no way be
    fitted in with existing remains. According to them, it was
    rectangular, and stood in the middle of a cloister, with each of
    whose sides it was connected by a cross-colonnade. The temple
    consisted of a great hall and an inner shrine. The architecture was
    probably Greek; certainly the statue was—made of blue-black marble
    (p. 19), the work of Bryaxis.

    (iii). _The Temple of Isis._ Isis, wife of Osiris, was equally
    united to his successor Serapis, and had in Ptolemaic times her
    temple on the plateau. North of the Pillar are some excavations that
    have been identified with it.

    (iv). _Two Sphinxes._ Found in the enclosure and set up south of the
    Pillar. Of Assouan granite.

    (v). _Fragments of a Frieze._ These, magnificently worked in
    granite, lie on the slope east of the Pillar; we pass them on the
    way up. Date:—about 1st cent. A.D. They may have belonged to the
    great entrance gate of the temple enclosure. He who meditates on
    them for a little may recapture some idea of the shrine. Note the
    Pillar itself so suggests vanished glory and solidity.

    This concludes the remains. They are disappointing for so famous a
    site, but there is one satisfaction: this is the actual spot. Long
    in doubt, it has been identified by the statues and inscriptions
    that have been found here; they are now in the Museum; _see_ Rooms
    6, 12, and 16.

                  *       *       *       *       *

    Just beyond the enclosure of Pompey’s Pillar we leave the tram route
    and turn to the right, reaching in ten minutes the Kom es Chogafa
    Catacombs.


                      CATACOMBS OF KOM ES CHOGAFA.


    Through the turnstile (5 piastres) is modern asphalt laid down to
    preserve the subterraneans from wet. Left, four fine sarcophagi of
    purplish granite. Above, the original level of the hill, which has
    been cut down by quarrying and excavations; in its slopes are some
    cemented passages, antique but uninteresting. On the top of the
    hill, a mosaic of black and white stones, much broken away. The
    entrance to the catacombs is down the larger of the two glassed
    well-shafts.

    The Catacombs of Kom es Chogafa (“Hill of Tiles”) are the most
    important in the city and unique anywhere: nothing quite like them
    has been discovered. They are unique both for their plan and for
    their decorations which so curiously blend classical and Egyptian
    designs; only in Alexandria could such a blend occur. Their size,
    their picturesque vistas, their eerie sculptures, are most
    impressive, especially on a first visit. Afterwards their spell
    fades for they are odd rather than beautiful, and they express
    religiosity rather than religion. Date—about the 2nd cent., A.D.
    when the old faiths began to merge and melt. Name of
    occupants—unknown. There is a theory that they began as a family
    vault which was developed by a burial syndicate. They were only
    discovered in 1900.

    The scheme should be grasped before descending; there are three
    stories, the lowest is under water. (_See_ Plan p. 148).

    The Staircase (A) is lit from a well, down which the dead bodies
    were lowered by ropes.—It ends at the Vestibule (B). Here are two
    semi-circular niches, each fitted with a bench and elegantly vaulted
    with a shell—a classical motive unknown to the art of ancient Egypt.
    Close by is the Rotunda (C): in its centre is a well, upon whose
    parapet stand 8 pillars, supporting a domed roof. A circular passage
    runs round the well.—Left from the Rotunda is the Banquet Hall (D),
    where the friends and relatives ate ceremonially in memory of the
    dead. It is a gloomy scene. Here, cut out of the limestone, are the
    three couches where they reclined upon mattresses; the table in the
    middle has disappeared; it was probably of wood. Pillars support the
    roof.—From the Rotunda a Staircase (E) goes down to the second
    story; the amazing Central Tomb is now revealed; weird effects can
    be got by adjusting the electric lights. The Staircase is roofed by
    a shell ornament; half-way down, it divides on each side a thing
    that looks like a prompter’s box; this masks yet another staircase
    that descends to the third story, now under water.


    THE CENTRAL TOMB.

    In the Vestibule (F) the Egyptian note predominates. In front, two
    fine columns with ornate capitals and two pilaster with square
    papyrus capitals—the four supporting a cornice adorned with the
    winged Sun (Ra), and guardian falcons. Inside the Vestibule, to
    right and left, are white limestone statues of a man and woman—the
    proprietor and his wife, perhaps. On the further wall the religious
    and artistic confusion increases. Two terrific bearded serpents
    guard the entrance to the Tomb Chamber, and each not only enfolds
    the pine-cone of Dionysus and the serpent-wand of Hermes, but also
    wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Above each serpent
    is a Medusa in a round shield. Over the lintel of the inner door is
    the winged Sun and a frieze of snakes.

    The Tomb Chamber (G) contains three large sarcophagi, all cut out of
    the rock. They are classical in style—decorated with festoons of
    fruit or flowers, Medusa Heads, Ox skulls, &c. The lids do not take
    off; the mummies would have been pushed in from the passage behind
    (_see_ below). But as a matter of fact none of three sarcophagi have
    ever been occupied; it is part of the queerness of Kom es Chogafa
    that its vast and elaborate apparatus for mourning should culminate
    in a void.

    In the niche over each sarcophagus are bas reliefs, Egyptian in
    style but executed with imperfect understanding.

    Centre niche (G.i). A mummy on a lion shaped bier: the lion wears
    the crown of Osiris and has at its feet the feather of Maat, goddess
    of truth. Behind the bier, Anubis as the god of embalming; at its
    head Thoth with the symbol of immortality; at its foot, Horus;
    beneath it three “Canopic” deities—vases for the intestines—there
    ought to be four.—Lateral relief: Left, a man with a priest, right a
    woman with a priest.

    Right-hand niche (G.ii). Graceful design of a prince, who wears the
    double crown of Egypt, offering a collar to the Apis Bull, who, with
    the Sun between his horns stands on a pedestal. Behind Apis, Isis,
    holding the feather of truth and stretching out her protective wings
    with good decorative effect.—Lateral reliefs: Left, a king before a
    god (Chons?); right, two “Canopic” deities, one ape headed, one a
    mummy.

    Left-hand niche (G.iii).—Similar to right hand, except that on the
    right lateral wall one of the “Canopic” deities has the head of a
    hawk.

    On either side of the entrance door stands an uncanny figure. Right,
    (as one goes out) is Anubis, with a dog’s head, but dressed up as a
    Roman soldier, with cuirass short sword lance and shield complete.
    Left, the god Sebek, who though mainly a crocodile is also crushed
    into military costume with cloak and spear. Perhaps the queer couple
    were meant to guard the tomb, but one must not read too much into
    them or into anything here; the workmen employed were only concerned
    to turn out a room that should look suitable for death, and judged
    by this standard they have succeeded.

    Surrounding the central tomb is a broad Passage (HHH) lined with
    cavities in two rows that provided accommodation for nearly 300
    mummies. Where the passage passes behind the central tomb one can
    see the apertures through which the three grand sarcophagi were
    hollowed out, and through which the mummies would have been
    introduced. Leading out of this passage is another tomb chamber (I)
    and, to the left, a big Gallery (JJJJ), fitted up with receptacles
    in the usual style.

                  *       *       *       *       *

    All the above chambers form part of a single scheme. We now return
    to the Rotunda (C), and enter, through a breach in the rock, an
    entirely distinct set of tombs. They are lighted by a square Well
    (K) and were reached by a separate staircase now ruinous. The Hall
    (L) is fancifully called the Hall of Caracalla because that emperor
    massacred many Alexandrian youths whom he had summoned to a review,
    and because many bones of men and horses have been found
    intermingled on its floors; it is lined with tomb cavities on the
    usual plan.—The Gallery (M) contains rather a charming tomb: it was
    once covered with white stucco and delicately painted. In the niche
    above the sarcophagus are Isis and her sister Nephtys, spreading
    their wings over the mummy of Osiris. More figures on the lateral
    walls. Above, on the inner wall, the soul as a bird. Above the
    entrance, the Sun and golden Vase on either side of which is a
    sphinx with her paw on a wheel.

    We now ascend the staircase (A). View of Mariout. Those who are not
    tired of empty tombs will find plenty more to the right, down a
    stairway cut in the rock.

Immediately below Kom es Chogafa flows the _Mahmoudieh Canal_, made by
Mohammed Ali (for the circumstances _see_ p. 91). There is a road along
it which leads, right, into the region of cotton warehouses. (Section
VI).—To the left one can walk or drive all the way to Nouzha (Section
IV). The route is partly pleasant partly not. It crosses, at Moharrem
Bey, the Farkha Canal, which leaves the Mahmoudieh Canal at right angles
and which went all the way to the sea.—Further on, there is a shady
tract called the “Champs Elysées” it resembles, neither for good or
evil, its Parisian original.

                       FROM THE SQUARE TO NOUZHA.


ROUTE:—Take Nouzha Tram (green trefoil) at the lower end of the
Boulevard Ramleh, just off the Square. The Rond Point Tram (white star)
passes through the Square, but does not go further than the Water
Works—about half-way to Nouzha.

CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—Municipal Gardens; Nouzha and Antoniadis
Gardens.

For the Boulevard Ramleh _see_ Section V. Having traversed it, the tram
bears to the right and passes the Alhambra Theatre, the only one in the
town—not a bad building.—Just beyond the Theatre a road leads left, to
the Cathedral of the _Coptic Catholic Patriarchate_, (p. 212) or Church
of the Resurrection. The building is not remarkable, but of interest to
all who would explore the ecclesiastical ramifications of Alexandria. It
was dedicated in 1902 by the Patriarch Cyril II and endowed by the
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, as an inscription by the entrance
(shortly to be removed) states; the alternative date—1618—reckons by the
Coptic Calendar, which begins not with the birth of Christ but with the
persecutions of the 3rd cent. (p. 47). The facade of the church imitates
that of St. John Lateran, Rome. Beyond the church are the British
Consulate and the Egyptian Government Hospital (Section V).

The Tram turns left, along the Rue Sultan Hussein, still popularly known
as the Rue d’Allemagne, and passes between the Menasce Schools (Jewish)
and Cromer Park, a small fenced garden reserved for ladies and
babies.—_Place Said_, a round space in the midst of which is a large
Ptolemaic Column, erected in memory of the retaking of Khartoum, Sept.
2nd, 1898; on each side of the column, statues of the lion-headed
goddess, Sekhet. The native women who sometimes sit in masses in the
Place are professional mourners and await a funeral out of the Egyptian
Government Hospital behind. Roads go from the Place: left, to Mazarita
Station on the Ramleh tram line (Section V); right, to the Rue Rosette.
(Section I).

Left, the _Municipal Gardens_, small but admirably planned; the
designer, M. Monfront, has shown real genius in his treatment of the
area. The gardens follow the line of the Arab Walls (p. 81) and also
cross the course of the old Farkha Canal that once connected the
Mahmoudieh Canal and the sea (p. 152). Both these features have been
utilised; the fortifications have turned into picturesque hillocks or
survive as masses of masonry, which, though of little merit in
themselves, have been cleverly grouped and look mediaeval by moonlight;
while the water of the canal has been preserved in an artificial pool,
the abode of ducks. The gardens should be thoroughly explored. In
them—visible from tram—is a _Statue of Nubar Pasha_, by Puech; the
tarboosh is too large but the general effect dignified; the left hand
rests on a tablet inscribed “La justice est la base de tout
Gouvernment,” and the same maxim appears on the pedestal. Nubar was an
Armenian—a politician whose honesty is variously estimated, though there
is no question as to his ability. He became minister under the Khedive
Ismail (1878) and tried to regulate his finance, also serving under
Tewfik. He was, as his favourite motto suggests, cautious in
temperament. He is buried outside the Armenian Church, (p. 143).

The tram touches the end of the Rue Rosette (Section I) and passes
through the belt of the gardens: they continue on the right, still
following the course of the vanished Arab walls and utilising the
acclivities, and are to be continued still further, as far as the
railway station; they will then form a great horseshoe.—Left are the
Roman Catholic Cemeteries, and in the second of these, at the end of the
main walk, is a fine _Antique Tomb_, which should be seen. It lies in a
hole; great walls of alabaster have fallen and exposed their shining
surfaces. The shrine (Heroon) of Pompey stood near here, and it has been
suggested that this was the actual place where his head was deposited
after his murderers had brought it to Julius Caesar; this is pure
conjecture, but the tomb may well date from the period (B.C. 48) for the
work is very good.—To the right, in the new part of the cemetery are
other ancient tombs, also a cemented shaft with foot holds cut on its
interior.

Almost opposite the entrance to the Cemetery is the War Memorial to
French Soldiers, a truncated obelisk of Carrara marble, designed as a
labour of love in memory of his fallen comrades by Mons. V. Erlanger,
the French architect of Alexandria and unveiled April 23, 1921 by Lord
Allenby.

The scroll facing the main thoroughfare bears the following inscription:

    “In memory of French Soldiers fallen during the Great War and
    offered by members of the British Community to the French Colony to
    Commemorate the glorious deeds of arms, performed by the French
    Armies 1914-1918.”

Now the tram turns, right, by the Rosetta Gate Police Station,
surmounted by a turret clock in commemoration of King Edward VII, and
comes to the Rond Point, where are the Waterworks, and up the rise Hadra
Prison; then crosses the railway, the ancient Hadra cemetery (_see_
Museum Room 19) and Hadra village, and reaches its terminus at Nouzha,
close to Nouzha railway station and to the Mahmoudieh Canal.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_Nouzha_ was in Ptolemaic times the suburb of Eleusis. Here lived
Callimachus the poet (p. 30); here (B.C. 168) Popillius the Roman
general checked the King of Syria who was about to seize Alexandria,
and, drawing a circle round him in the sand, obliged him to decide
forthwith between peace and war. Here (A.D. 640), were quartered the
cavalry of Amr (p. 55), before he entered the town.—The Gardens are
across the railway. They have been developed by the Municipality out of
a small park of Ismail’s, and are most beautiful; if one could judge
Alexandria by her gardens one would do nothing but praise. Some are
formalised, others free; those who like pelicans will find them in a
pond to the right; the zoological garden, a bandstand, and a restaurant,
are straight ahead; view from over the top over Lake Hadra towards Abou
el Nawatir (Section V).—Right of the bandstand is an enclosure entered
by payment; this too should be visited as the trees and flowers are
fine; glasshouses also.

Above the pelican pond a small gate leads from the Nouzha Gardens into
the _Antoniadis Gardens_ (entrance charge; varying according to the day
of week). These too belong to the Municipality of Alexandria. They are
full of modern statues, which, though of no merit, make a pleasant
formal effect. The trees and creepers are fine, and there is a beautiful
lawn at the back of the house. Here, until recently, lived the
Antoniadis family, wealthy Greeks.

In the field behind the Antoniadis Gardens is an antique _Tomb_. It is
easiest reached through the back gate, which a gardener will sometimes
unlock; otherwise one must return to the Nouzha Gardens, pass out, and
follow the canal for a little way, finally turning to the left. The tomb
is behind an absurd spiral of rockwork. It is reached down a flight of
steps and the hall is often under water. Same plan as at Anfouchi (p.
126); a sunken hall, out of which three tomb chambers open.

The road beyond the Gardens, along the edge of the Canal, is pretty, and
probably follows the course of the ancient Canal to Canopus, whither the
Alexandrians used to go out in barges, to enjoy themselves and to
worship Serapis. In one place it skirts the waters of Hadra.

The other way (west) the Canal flows into the city (Section II) finally
entering the Harbour.—(For history of the Canal _see_ p. 91).

There is a road direct from Nouzha to Sidi Gaber (Section V) by the side
of the lake. It passes, left, the place where two colossal statues were
discovered: Antony as Osiris, and Cleopatra as Isis: Antony is in the
Museum (Garden Court, p. 120).

                               SECTION V.

                                -------

                       FROM THE SQUARE TO RAMLEH.


ROUTE:—By the Boulevard Ramleh to the Tram Line terminus—10 min. walk.
Then take tram with red label to Bulkeley, San Stefano, and Victoria.
Tram with blue label goes to San Stefano only, _via_ Bacos. The service
is fair.

CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—The Sea; the view from Abou el Nawatir;
private gardens; the Spouting Rocks.


We start at the north-east corner of the Square, and take the Rue de
l’Ancienne Bourse, in which are, right, the Union Club frequented by
British, and, left, the former Bourse—the latter not a bad building,
with a portico of marble columns and a vaulted interior; it is now the
offices of the Lloyd Triestino. The street leads into the Boulevard
Ramleh—turn to right.

The Boulevard (officially Rue de la Gare de Ramleh) is a busy shabby
thoroughfare, full of people who are escaping to or from the tram
terminus.

Right from Boulevard, in Rue Debbane, is a Greek and Syrian Catholic
Church, dedicated to St. Peter. (p. 213). It was built by Count Debbane,
a Syrian under Brazilian protection who received his title from the
Pope. His family vault extends along the whole length of the Chancel.
The scene is of no interest, but typical of the complexities of religion
and race at Alexandria.

Left from Boulevard, at end of Rue Averoff, is the church of the
Armenian Catholics (p. 213).

Right from Boulevard, in Rue de l’Eglise Copte, is the _Cathedral of the
Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate_ (p. 212) dedicated to St. Mark. Those who
have never seen a Coptic Church should look in. It is fatuously ugly. On
the screen that divides nave from sanctuary are several pictures—among
them St. Damiana with her wheel; she is the native Egyptian Saint who
was probably the origin of St. Catherine of Alexandria: round her are
the forty maidens who shared her martyrdom. In the sanctuary are some
pictures of St. Mark, whose primitive church is wrongly supposed to have
stood on this site (p. 46); he is shown writing his Gospel or standing
between Cleopatra’s Needle and Pompey’s Pillar. Outside the Church are
the Schools, ineptly adorned with a Lion of St. Mark of the Venetian
type.

Right from Boulevard, the Rue Nebi Daniel leads past the chief Jewish
Synagogue to the Rue Rosette (Section I).

The Boulevard reaches the tram terminus. To the right is the road to
Nouzha (Section IV), to the left the sea and the New Quays (Section II).

                  *       *       *       *       *

On this featureless spot once arose a stupendous temple, the Caesareum,
and a pair of obelisks, _Cleopatra’s Needles_.

    (i). HISTORY OF THE CAESAREUM.—Cleopatra began it in honour of
    Antony (p. 26). After their suicide Octavian finished it in honour
    of himself. (B.C. 13). He was worshipped there as Caesar Augustus,
    and the temple remained an imperial possession until Christian
    times. Constantius II (A.D. 354) intended to present it to the
    Church, but before the transference could be effected St.
    Athanasius, who was always energetic, had held an Easter Service
    inside it. The Emperor was offended. Two years later his troops
    nearly killed Athanasius inside the building, and gave it to the
    Arians. Arians and Orthodox continued to fight for and in it and
    smashed it to pieces. (p. 49). Athanasius, just back from his final
    exile, built on the ruins a church which was dedicated to St.
    Michael but usually retained the famous title Caesareum. It became
    the Cathedral of Alexandria, superseding St. Theonas (p. 189). Here
    in 416 Hypatia was torn to pieces by tiles (p. 51). Here in 640 the
    Patriarch Cyrus held a solemn service before betraying the city to
    the Arabs (p. 55). Date of final destruction—912.

    (ii). APPEARANCE. Nothing is known of the architecture of the
    temple, but the Jewish philosopher Philo (p. 63) thus writes of it
    in the day of its glory:

        “It is a piece incomparably above all others. It stands by a
        most commodious harbour: wonderful high and large in proportion;
        an eminent sea-mark: full of choice paintings and statues with
        donatives and oblatives in abundance; and then it is beautiful
        all over with gold and silver; the model curious and regular in
        the disposition of the parts, as galleries, libraries, porches,
        courts, halls, walks, and consecrated groves, as glorious as
        expense and art could make them, and everything in the proper
        place; besides that, the hope and comfort of seafaring men,
        either coming in or going out.”

    (iii). THE OBELISKS. In front of the Caesareum (between present tram
    terminus and sea) stood “Cleopatra’s Needles” of which one is now in
    the Central Park, New York, and the other on the Embankment, London,
    They had nothing to do with Cleopatra till after her death. They
    were cut in the granite quarries of Assouan for Thothmes III (B.C.
    1500), and set up by him at Heliopolis near Cairo, before the temple
    of the Rising Sun. In B.C. 13 they were transferred here by the
    engineer Pontius. They rested not directly on their bases but each
    on four huge metal crabs, one of which has been recovered. Statues
    of Hermes or of Victory tipped them. In the Arab period, when all
    around decayed, they became the chief marvel of the city. One fell.
    They remained in situ until the 19th cent., when they were parted
    and took their last journey, the fallen one to England in 1877, the
    other to the United States two years later.

The walls of the Arab city used to reach the sea at this point (cf.
Belon’s View, p. 83).; they ended in a tower that was swept away for the
New Quays. We now take the tram.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The first half mile of the tram lines traverses ground of immense
historical fame. Every inch was once sacred or royal. On the football
fields to the left were the Ptolemaic Palaces (p. 17) stretching down to
the sea and projecting into it at the Promontory of Lochias (present
Silsileh). There was also an island palace on a rock that has
disappeared. The walls of the Mouseion, too, are said to have extended
into the area, but we know no details and can only be certain that the
Ancient World never surpassed the splendour of the scene. On the right,
from the higher ground, the Theatre overlooked it, and the dramas of
Aeschylus and Euripides could be performed against the background of a
newer and a greater Greece. No eye will see that achievement again, no
mind can imagine it. Grit and gravel have taken its place to-day.

Right of the line on leaving:—The British Consulate, an imposing pile.
Next to it, the _Egyptian Government Hospital_ probably on the site of
the Ancient Theatre, so a visit should be made. In the garden is the
tomb of Dr. Schiess a former Director; an early Christian sarcophagus
has been used, and on each side of it are impressive Christian columns,
probably from the church of St. Theonas (p. 46) and each carved with a
cross in a little shrine. In the spiral ascent above the tomb are other
antiquities and a howitzer of Arabi’s: on the summit, an antique marble
column, erected in memory of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee.

                  *       *       *       *       *

MAZARITA STA.—A road leads, right, to the Public Gardens (Section IV)
and, left, to the Promontory of Silsileh (see above). The promontory,
like the rest of the coast, has subsided; in classical times it was
broader and longer than now, and extended in breakwaters towards the
Pharos (Fort Kait Bey), thus almost closing the entrance to the Eastern
Harbour. The private port of the Ptolemies lay immediately to its left.
A beacon, the Pharillon, was at its point in Arab times. The original
Church of St. Mark, where the evangelist was buried, must have stood on
the shore to its right. There is nothing to see to-day except a
coast-guard station and the exit of the main drain.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHATBY STA.—The tram has now pierced the ancient royal city and enters
the region of the dead, where owing to the dryness of the ground the
cemeteries both ancient and modern have been dug. Right, the modern
cemeteries, Jewish nearest the tram line, behind them English, then
Greek and Armenian, then Catholic, opening into the Aboukir road
(Section I). Close to the sta. are the spacious schools of the Greek
Community, and the Orwa el Woska schools. Left of the station, is the
Sultanian Institute of Hydrobiology, containing a small but interesting
aquarium and an extensive and valuable technical library, also models of
fishing craft, nets and marine instruments. Visit by arrangement with
the Director, Prof. Pachundaki. In the enclosure in front of the
Institute some ancient Mosaics have been recently (1921) discovered;
they are said to be of fine period and in good condition, but are not on
exhibition yet; it is to be hoped that they will be accessible shortly.
Traces of ancient roads and drains have also been found here.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHATBY-LES-BAINS STA.—Turn left, as far as the fire station, then turn
right. Here, in the waste to the left of the road, is the great Chatby
Necropolis, the oldest in the Ptolemaic city (_see_ Museum, particularly
Room 20 and Garden Court). Little remains. There is a tomb group close
to the road of the Anfouchi type (p. 126) _i.e._ a sunken court out of
which the burial places open; at the end of the tombs is a double
sarcophagus of the shape of a bed, with cushions of stone.—Right of the
tram line, other burial places, Ptolemaic and Roman, can be found all
the way to the canal.—The tram goes through a cutting; right is the fine
French Lycée, subsidized by the French Government.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CAMP DE CÉSAR STA.—Caesar never camped here. An unattractive suburb,
anciently Eleusis by the Sea.

                  *       *       *       *       *

IBRAHIMIEH STA.—Then to the right flat fertile land appears. This,
geologically, is delta deposit, which has been silted up against the
narrow spur of limestone on which Alexandria stands (p. 5). In the
foreground, the green turf of the Sporting Club; further, the trees of
Nouzha and the waters of Hadra. Traces of ancient Cemeteries continue on
the dry ground on the left.

                  *       *       *       *       *

SPORTING CLUB STA.—Close to the Grand Stand of the Race Course. Bathing
beach left.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CLEOPATRA STA.—Cleopatra never lived here. Right begin the famous fig
trees of Sidi Gaber, reputed the best in Egypt. Also broad leaved
bananas, maize, &c. A pleasant road leads across the railway and by the
side of the lake to Nouzha Gardens (Section IV); it can be beautiful
here in the evening.—Left from the sta., at the base of a cliff by the
edge of the sea, is a Ptolemaic tomb with painted walls, but even while
one describes such things they are being destroyed. The reefs by this
tomb form the pretty little “Friars’ pool.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

SIDI GABER STA.—Close to the main-line railway sta. where all the Cairo
expresses stop.—Left, a road leads between fine trees to the
_Abercrombie Monument_, a poor affair, but interesting to Englishmen, as
it commemorates our exploits in 1801 (p. 88). It is a three-sided column
of white marble, surmounted by a flaming urn. Inscription:

    “To the memory of Sir Ralph Abercrombie K.B. & C. and the Officers
    and Men who fell at the battle of Alexandria, March 21st, 1801....
    As his life was honourable so was his death glorious. His memory
    will be recorded in the annals of his country—will be sacred to
    every British soldier—and embalmed in the recollection of a grateful
    posterity.”

Close to the Monument is the modern Mosque of Sidi Gaber, a beneficent
local saint, who flies about at night, looks after children, &c.

                  *       *       *       *       *

MUSTAPHA PACHA STA.—Right, up the road, is the hill of Abou el Nawatir,
the highest near Alexandria, overlooking the lakes of Hadra and Mariout;
exquisite view, especially by evening light. The square enclosure at the
top belongs to the reservoir; to its S.E. half-way between it and the
railway, a _Gun_ lies in the sand. This is a relic of the fighting of
July 1882. General Alison placed most of his artillery up here (p. 96),
and the gun still points to the Mahmoudieh Canal, in the direction of
Arabi’s camp.—Left of Mustapha Pacha Sta. on the rise, are the British
Barracks, occupying the site of the Roman; history repeats herself, just
as she has done in the Cemeteries. Octavian’s town of Nicopolis, which
he founded in B.C. 30 to overawe Alexandria (p. 44), began here. Among
the Roman Units here quartered were the 2nd Trajana Fortis and the 3rd
Cyrenaic; the British are too numerous to record.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CARLTON STA.—The big Villa up the hill to the right was built by a
German in the Greek style, regardless of expense or taste.

                  *       *       *       *       *

BULKELEY STA.—We are now in the heart of Ramleh (“Sand”) the struggling
suburb where the British and other foreigners reside. Lovely private
gardens, the best in Egypt. Left of the sta. is Stanley Bay, a fine bit
of coast scenery and a favourite bathing place: also the Anglican Church
of All Saints’. (p. 213).

The tramline here divides into two branches that reunite at San Stefano.
The left branch—more direct—goes by Saba Pacha (pretty cove in coast),
Glymenopoulo, Mazloum, Zizinia—all bathing places. The right branch,
through pretty palm gloves, via Fleming, Bacos, Seffer, Schutz,
Gianaclis (left is the fine new Mosque of Ahmed Pacha Yehia, the
statesman, with provision for his tomb).

                  *       *       *       *       *

SAN STEFANO STA.—Close to the Casino, a fashionable summer hotel, by the
side of a sea that seems especially fresh and blue. There are Symphony
concerts here in the season. The audience however comes not to listen
but to talk; their noise is so great that from a little distance the
orchestra appears to be performing in dumb show.

The tram goes on by St. George, Laurens and Palais stations to Sidi
Bishr, on the edge of a desert coast. Fine walk or ride past Sidi Bishr
Mosque to the _Spouting Rocks_. These are most remarkable. Masses of
limestone project into the sea, which penetrates beneath them and spouts
up through blow holes and cracks. Some of the vents have been
artificially squared, and the Ancient Alexandrians, who loved scientific
toys, may have fitted them up with musical horns or mechanical
mills.—The expedition may be continued along the coast to the woods of
Montazah (Section VII).

                  *       *       *       *       *

VICTORIA STA. The terminus. Here is a Ry. sta. for the Aboukir and
Rosetta lines (Section VII), also Victoria College, a huge building. It
offers an education on English Public School lines to residents in
Egypt, whatever their creed or race, and was much approved by Lord
Cromer, who founded a scholarship here.

The coast walk from Alexandria to Ramleh is rarely taken but is
charming—low crumbly cliffs, sandy beaches, flat rocks, and vestiges of
ancient houses and tombs that help one to realise how the whole site of
the city has sunk. There is no road east of Silsileh. The scheme for a
grandiose “Corniche” drive has fortunately failed, and the scenery has
escaped the standardised dulness that environs most big towns.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Ramleh can also be reached by the Aboukir Road, an extension of the Rue
Rosette (Section I).




------------------------------------------------------------------------




                              SECTION VI.

                                -------

                        FROM THE SQUARE TO MEX.


ROUTE:—By the Rue des Soeurs and Gabbari, taking the Mex Tram (White
Star). The journey is uncomfortable and uninspiring, but Mex is
pleasant.


We start from the south side of the Square, down the long Rue des
Soeurs, which takes its name from the Roman Catholic Convent and School
near its entrance. The surroundings become squalid.

Right of Rue des Soeurs:—Rue Behari Bey leads to the mound of
_Kom-el-Nadoura_, which rises abruptly out of mean streets. Its history
before the arrival of Napoleon (1798 p. 86) is unknown. His engineer
Cafarelli fortified it for him, and it held back the British advance in
1801, (p. 88). The entrance is on the south side, through a doorway by a
winding path fringed with prickly pear and pepper trees. The summit—104
feet above the sea—is now used as a signalling station and observatory
under the Ports and Lights Administration. Interesting set of
instruments, and fine view of harbour and city. At the N.N.W. corner are
some remains of Cafarelli’s masonry.—Outside the Fort, in the Rue
Babel-Akhdar (Section II) is the Gold and Silver Bazaar.

Left of Rue des Soeurs is the Genenah, a curious rabbit warren.

The tram passes down Rue Ibrahim Premier. To the right, close to the
docks, in the Rue Karam, is a Franciscan church and school. They are
modern and of no interest, but stand on a site that was important
historically. Here was the _Church of St. Theonas_ (p. 46) and the early
palace of the bishops. Here St. Athanasius was brought up. The Arabs
(641) incorporated what they found into a fine Mosque, called the Mosque
of the Seventy (from some fallacious connection with the Septuagint) or
the Mosque of the 1000 Columns. It was on the lines of the Mosque of Ibn
Touloun at Cairo; the Rue Karam bisects its area; its prayer niche faced
south west. It was standing in a ruined condition when the French came,
and was turned into artillery barracks.

Just before the tram reaches the Canal we pass, right, the cotton
exchange of Minet-el-Bassal. A visit—introduction necessary—is
interesting. The Exchange is round a pleasant courtyard, with a fountain
in the midst. Samples are exhibited. The whole neighbourhood is given up
to this, the main industry, of Alexandria; warehouses; picturesque
wooded machinery for cleaning the cotton and pressing it into bales; in
the season, the streets are slippery with greasy fluff.

The Mahmoudieh Canal (p. 91) is now crossed. The banks have here their
original stone casings and double descents, recalling the commercial
enterprise of Mohammed Ali. A walk along the banks to the left is dirty
but attractive; it can terminate at the Kom es Chogafa Catacombs
(Section III). Right, the Canal enters the Western Harbour.

Then comes the district of Gabbari, called after a sheikh of that name.
Here was the Western Cemetery of the Ancient City; the finds have been
taken to the Museum (Room 14). Nothing interesting until Mex.

_Mex_, once a fishing village, might have become a prosperous suburb of
Alexandria, like Ramleh. But the intervening slums have choked access to
it. It lies midway on the big curve of the Western Harbour, the waters
of Lake Mariout being close behind. There is a good pier, with a wooden
causeway that leads on to a distant rock. The little sea front has
rather a Neapolitan air.

Beyond Mex are the limestone quarries that provided the stone for the
ancient and the modern towns. They are cut in the ridge that here
separates lake and sea.

The village of Dekhela lies further along the beach. Fine walk from it
to Amrieh (Section VIII). Beyond it the desert begins, strewn with
fragments of antique pottery.

Beyond Dekhela, at the western point of the Harbour: _Fort Agame_. A
strategic point in Napoleonic times (p. 86) and in the Bombardment of
Alexandria (p. 94). Magnificent bathing. Just off the Fort is _Marabout
Island_, so called from the tomb of a local saint which stands here,
adorned with votive models of boats. Makrizi (writing in the 14th cent.)
says that men lived longer on Marabout Island than any where else in the
world, but no one at all lives here now. From it extends the chain of
reefs that close the entrance of the Western Harbour (p. 6).—It is easy
to visit this district from Alexandria by sailing boat, but not easy to
get back again in the evening when the wind drops.

                                -------

                          ABOUKIR AND ROSETTA.


ROUTE:—By train from the Main (Cairo) sta., or from Sidi Gaber, where
all trains stop, and which is also a sta. for the Ramleh tram (Section
VI).

CHIEF POINTS OF INTEREST:—Montazah; Canopus; Aboukir Bay; Rosetta.


[Illustration: COUNTRY ROUND ALEXANDRIA]


At Sidi Gaber sta. is a view of Lake Hadra on the right.—Five stations
on:—Victoria, close to the College and tram terminus.—The train passes

spring.

MONTAZAH STA.—Close to the station is the _Summer Resort_ of the
ex-Khedive Abbas II, now (1922) being restored and refurnished by King
Fouad. Permission to enter should be obtained if possible, for the
scenery is unique in Egypt and of the greatest beauty. The road leads by
roses, oleanders and pepper trees. From it a road turns, right, up the
hill to the Selamlik (men’s quarters), built by the Khedive in a style
that was likely to please his Austrian mistress; on the terrace in front
is a sun dial and some guns. From the terrace, _View_ of the circular
bay with its fantastic promontories and breakwaters; the coast to the
right is visible as far as Aboukir, whose minaret peeps over a distant
headland; to the left are the Montazah woods; beneath, down precipitous
steps, a curved parade. Beautiful walks in every direction, and perfect
bathing. On the promontory to the right is a kiosk, and at its point are
some remains of buildings or baths—fragments of the ancient Taposiris
Parva that once stood here; some of them form natural fishponds. The
woods are Pines Maritimes, imported by the Khedive from Europe, and in
the western section, beyond the Pigeon House, the trees have grown high.
Various buildings are in the estate; in one corner are the foundations
of an enormous mosque. During the recent war (1914-1919) Montazah became
a Red Cross Hospital; thousands of convalescent soldiers passed through
it and will never forget the beauty and the comfort that they found
there.

[Illustration: ABOUKIR AND DISTRICT]


Aboukir, though intimately connected with Alexandria, has a history of
its own. Three main periods.

    (i). ANCIENT (_see_ also p. 7).

    Geologically, this is the end of the long limestone spur that
    projects from the Lybian desert (p. 5). The Nile had to round it to
    reach the sea, and it is to the Nile that its early fame is due. The
    river poured out just to the east, through the “Canopic” Mouth,
    which has now dried up, and there were settlements here centuries
    before Alexandria was founded. On the left bank of the Nile (south
    of the present Fort Ramleh) Herodotus (B.C. 450) saw a temple to
    Heracles, and was told that Paris and Helen had sought shelter here
    on their flight to Troy—shelter that was refused by the local
    authorities, who disapproved of their irregular union. There was a
    second settlement at Menouthis (Fort Ramleh itself), and a third and
    most famous at _Canopus_ (present Fort Tewfikieh), from which the
    whole district took its name.

    Canopus, according to Greek legend, was a pilot of Menelaus who was
    bitten here by a serpent as they returned from Troy, and, dying,
    became the tutelary God. The legend, like that of Paris and Helen,
    shows how interested were the Greeks in the district, but has no
    further importance. There is also a legend that Canopus was an
    Egyptian God whose body was an earthenware jar: this too may be
    discredited. With the foundation of Alexandria (B.C. 331) the
    district lost much of its trade, but became a great fashionable and
    religious resort. There was a canal from Alexandria, probably
    connecting with the Nile just where it entered the sea, and the
    Alexandrians glided along it in barges, singing and crowned with
    flowers. In connection with his new cult of Serapis (p. 18) Ptolemy
    Soter built a temple here (_see_ below) whose fame spread over the
    world and whose rites made the Romans blush with shame or pale with
    envy; here originated the idea, still so widely held in the west,
    that Egypt is a land of licentiousness and mystery. The district
    decayed as soon as Christianity was established; it had not, like
    Alexandria, a solid basis for its existence in trade. But Paganism
    lingered here, and as late as the end of the 5th century twenty
    camel-loads of idols were found secreted in a house and were carried
    away to make a bonfire at Alexandria. Demons gave trouble even in
    later times.

    (ii). CHRISTIAN.

    The Patriarch Cyril (p. 51) having destroyed the cults of Serapis
    and Isis in the district (A.D. 389) sent out the relics of St. Cyr
    to take their place. The relics were so intermingled with those of
    another martyr, St. John, that St. John had to be brought too, and a
    church to them both arose just to the south of the present Fort Kait
    Bey. The two Saints remained quiet for 200 years, but then began to
    disentangle themselves and work miracles, and recovered for the
    district some of its ancient popularity; indeed many of their cures
    are exactly parallel to those effected in the temple of Serapis.
    With the Arab invasion their church vanishes, but St. Cyr has given
    his name to modern Aboukir (“Father Cyr.”) In the 9th century the
    Canopic branch of the Nile dried up. The Turks built some forts here
    for coastal defence, but history does not recommence until the
    arrival of Nelson.

    (iii). MODERN.

    In Napoleonic times Aboukir saw two great battles.

        (_a_). _“Battle of the Nile._”

        For the event that led to this engagement _see_ p. 86. Brueys,
        Napoleon’s admiral, brought his fleet into the bay for safety,
        and anchored them in a long line, about two miles from the
        coast. He had 13 Men-of-War, 4 Frigates, 1182 canons, and 8000
        men. To the north was “Nelson’s Island,” as it is now called,
        which he had fortified and upon which his line was supposed to
        rest. His flagship, the _Orient_, was midway in the line. He
        took up this position on July 7th, 1798.

        On August 1st Nelson arrived in pursuit, with 14 Men-of-War,
        1012 canons and 8068 men. The wind was N.W., a usual direction
        in summer. Half his fleet, including his flagship the
        _Vanguard_, attacked Brueys from the expected quarter, the east.
        The other half, led by the _Goliath_, executed the brilliant
        manœuvre that brought us victory. It gave Brueys a double
        surprise: in the first place it passed between the head of his
        line and “Nelson Island” where he thought there was no room; in
        the second place it took up a position to his west, between him
        and the shore, where he thought the water was too shallow. Thus
        he was caught between two fires—attacked by the whole British
        Fleet with the exception of the _Culloden_, which, sailing too
        near Nelson Island, stranded.

        The engagement began at 6.00 p.m. At 7.00 Brueys was killed, at
        9.30 the _Orient_ caught fire and blew up shortly afterwards;
        the explosion was tremendous and terminated the first act of the
        battle; an interval of appalled silence ensued. Casabianca was
        sailing the _Orient_, and it was on her “burning deck” that the
        boy of Mrs. Hemans’ poem stood. The fighting recommenced,
        continuing through the night, and ending at midday on the 2nd
        with the complete victory of Nelson. The French fleet had been
        annihilated; only two Men-of-War and two Frigates escaped, and
        Napoleon had lost for ever his command of the Mediterranean.
        Nelson accordingly signalled the following message:—

            Almighty God having blessed His Majesty’s arms with victory,
            the Admiral intends returning public thanksgiving for the
            same at two o’clock this day, and he recommends every ship
            doing the same as soon as convenient.

        The French expected an attack on Alexandria, but Nelson had
        suffered too much himself to attempt this; having rested for a
        little, he dispersed his fleet, leaving only a few ships behind
        to watch the coast. In his despatches home he stated that the
        engagement had taken place not far from the (Rosetta) mouth of
        the Nile; hence the official “Battle of the Nile” instead of the
        more accurate “Naval Battle of Aboukir.”

        (_b_). _Land Battle of Aboukir._

        Less important than its predecessor, but the strategy is
        interesting, and Napoleon himself was present. For the events
        that led up to it _see_ p. 87; Turkey, at the instigation of
        England, had declared war on France, and in July 1799 the Turks
        occupied Aboukir Bay and landed 15,000 men. Their left rested on
        the present Fort Ramleh, their right on the present Fort
        Tewfikieh, their camp was in the narrow extremity of the
        peninsula, between the redoubt and the Fort at the very tip.
        They were supported on three sides by their fleet, which was
        stationed in the Mediterranean, in the Bay of Aboukir, and in
        the (vanished) Lake of Aboukir. From this stronghold they
        proposed to overrun Egypt.

        On receiving the news, Napoleon hurried down from Cairo and
        arrived (July 25th) with only 10,000 men, mostly cavalry. Murat
        and Kléber accompanied him. He began by clearing the Turkish gun
        boats out of Lake Aboukir; then his force attacked Forts Ramleh
        and Tewfikieh, while his cavalry under Murat, advancing over the
        level ground between them, drove the flying defenders of each
        into the Mediterranean and the Bay respectively. 5,400 Turks
        were drowned. The tip of the peninsula remained and resisted
        vigorously, but Napoleon managed to mount some of his guns on
        the hard spit of sand that still extends along the shore of the
        Bay, and thus to cannonade the Turkish Camp, which was finally
        taken by storm.


RUINS OF CANOPUS.

The ruins (_see_ above) lie round Fort Tewfikieh which is seen to the
left as the train runs into the station. They were once of interest, but
have been almost entirely destroyed by the military authorities, who use
the limestone blocks for road making, and allow treasure hunting to go
on. The remains are not easy to find, as the area is pitted with
excavations. Consult map.

    (_a_) About 50 yds. from the gateway of the fort, in a hollow to the
    left of the road, are two huge _Fragments_ of a granite temple. Here
    were found the busts of Rameses II in the Museum (Room 7) and the
    colossi of the same King and his daughter (Museum, Court). Date of
    statues:—B.C. 1300.

    (_b_) Further to the left, round the Fort, is the site of the
    _Temple of Serapis_, the most famous building on the peninsula, and
    celebrated throughout the antique world. It was dedicated by Ptolemy
    III Euergetes (p. 15) and his wife Berenice. A few years later (B.C.
    238) their baby daughter died, and the priests met here in conclave
    to make her a goddess, and incidentally to endorse some reforms in
    the Calendar that the King, who had a scientific mind, was pressing.
    The pronouncement has been preserved in the “Decree of Canopus,” now
    one of the chief documents for Ptolemaic history. As for miracles,
    the temple even outstripped the original Temple of Serapis at
    Alexandria: invalids who slept here even by proxy discovered next
    day that they were well. It was also the abode of magic and
    licentiousness according to its enemies, and of philosophy according
    to its friends. Christianity attacked it. Just before its
    destruction (A.D. 289) Antoninus, an able pagan reactionary, settled
    here, and tried to revive the cult. “Often he told his disciples
    that after his time there would be no temple, and that the great and
    venerable sanctuary would remain only as an unmeaning mass of ruins,
    forgotten by all.” (Eunapius, life of Edesius). Antoninus was right.

    In ancient time the Temple probably stood on the highest ground, but
    with the general rising of level the site is now in a deep
    depression and must be hunted for patiently. An oblong space has
    been cleared and some columns and capitals from the excavations have
    been ranged round it, but it is impossible to reconstruct the
    original plan, and much has yet to be unearthed. Indeed it is not
    quite certain that this is the right temple; an inscription has been
    discovered dedicating it not to Serapis but to Osiris—with whom
    however Serapis was often identified. The columns are of granite or
    of stucco-coated limestone. Beneath the broken tin shelter was once
    a pretty mosaic. The finest object is a stupendous fluted column of
    red granite that lies in a pit close by; no use for it has yet
    occurred to the military authorities. To the south and east of the
    Temple were the houses of the priests, showing fine cemented
    passages; these have been destroyed.

    The canal by which revellers and worshippers approached this shrine
    ran to the south, through the low land by the railway; its course is
    uncertain; its exit was either into the (vanished) Nile, or into
    Aboukir Bay.

    (_c_) _The Upper Baths._ These lie about 100 yds. nearer the sea, on
    the slope just above the corner of the great bay that stretches to
    Montazah (p. 175). When excavated a few years ago they were almost
    perfect. The swimming bath—lined with the hard pink cement that
    indicates Ptolemaic or Roman work—had at the top a double step for
    the bathers. All round its sides were inserted large earthenware
    pots, their mouths level with the surface. Of this unique building a
    small fragment now survives. The brick central cistern and the hot
    baths can also still be traced.

    (_d_). _The Lower Baths and Broken Colossus._—Continuing to round
    Fort Tewfikieh we reach the coast and follow it N.E. Awash with the
    sea are the foundations of some large baths, showing the entrance
    channels which were probably closed with sluices, also some grooves
    of unknown use. On the shore above are the hot baths of the same
    establishment, retaining traces of pink cement. In the surf to the
    left lie blocks of granite: closely inspected, they resolve into
    fragments of a Colossus (Rameses II?) and a sphinx.

    (_e_). _Catacombs._—Fifty yards on, at a point about half-way
    between the coast and the fort are a couple of catacombs, lying each
    of them in a hollow. One has a subterranean room, the other a
    sarcophagus slide. Traces of tombs and tunnels all over the area and
    along the low cliff by the shore.

    This completes our survey of Canopus, once so enchanting a spot. Of
    its ancient delights only the air and the sea remain.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Continue to follow the coast. Perfect bathing. To the right, half-way
between the coast and the railway sta. in some rising ground, are
catacombs that have been filled in. Then comes the end of the
promontory, which is fine. There are two forts:—Fort Saba, closing the
neck, where the French resisted when the Turks landed in 1799 (_see_
above); and Fort Kait Bey, on the extremity, founded in the 15th cent.
by the Sultan of that name as part of his defence scheme against the
Turks (cf. Fort Kait Bey at Alexandria, p. 81). The views are good, with
the Mediterranean on one side and the tranquil semi-circle of Aboukir
Bay on the other, and from here or from Fort Ramleh the scene of the
“Battle of the Nile” can be surveyed, and Nelson’s great manoeuvre
appreciated; “Nelson’s Island” from which the French line depended and
where the Culloden was wrecked lies straight ahead. (_see_ above.) The
promontory was anciently called Zephyrium, because it caught the cool
zephyr winds; here stood a little temple to Aphrodite and when the great
queen Arsinoe, died in B.C. 270, one of the court admirals had the happy
idea of associating her with the elder goddess so that mariners might
render thanks to both. The shrine then became fashionable and Queen
Berenice hung up her hair here in 244 as a thank-offering for her
husband’s safe return; in the following year the hair was snatched up to
heaven, where it may still be observed on any fine night as the
constellation of Coma Berenice. The temple was less fortunate, and all
that remains of it is the base of a column, down among the rocks.—In
Christian times the Church of St. Cyr and St. John (_see_ above) stood
here, on the side of Aboukir Bay.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_Aboukir Bay._—The shore is airless and there are palm trees, the waters
shallow. From a boat one can look down on the mud in which the Orient,
Brueys’ flagship, has disappeared with all her treasure; attempts have
been made to locate her, but in vain. Good sailing. Turtle fishing. On
the projecting spit to which Napoleon dragged his guns (_see_ above) is
the landing enclosure for the fishing boats; many of the fishermen are
Sicilians; they have lived at Aboukir for generations and form a
community by themselves. Here (site uncertain) once stood Menouthis.

Fort Ramleh.—Topped by the waterworks. Magnificent view. The flat ground
to the south marks the Canopic Mouth of the Nile, through which
Herodotus entered Egypt; here Heracleum stood (_see_ above).

About quarter mile S.W. of Fort Ramleh, and close to a small modern
pumping tower, are the so-called _Baths of Cleopatra_. She had nothing
to do with them, but they are worth seeing. The western outer wall, of
limestone blocks, is well preserved. Steps lead up through it. Within
are pavements of pebble mosaic, fragments of stucco, a stone with a
drain groove, &c. In a chamber to the left, is an oblong bath nearly six
feet deep; steps lead down to it and in the centre of its pebbled floor
is a little depression; in the edge of the brim and on the wall opposite
are niches, as if to support beams, and provision for the entrance and
exit of the water can also be seen. Further on, past a small stucco
cistern, is an entrance to a small room which contains an oblong bath to
lie down in, quite modern and suburban in appearance; close to it, under
a niche, is a footbath—the bather sat on a seat which has disappeared
but whose supports can be seen.—These baths are all in the western part
of the enclosure; the rest contains other and larger chambers but is in
worse preservation. It is much to be wished that these baths, which have
been recently excavated, could be protected properly; otherwise they
will share the fate of the other antiquities within the military zone.

_Aboukir Village_, to which we return through palm trees, contains
nothing of note.

                  *       *       *       *       *

On leaving Mamourah Junction (p. 176) the railway to Rosetta bears to
the right, and crosses the salt marshy ground over which the Canopic
branch of the Nile once flowed to the sea. Rural Egypt can be seen at
last. Beyond El Tarh station the train crosses a bit of Lake Edku; view
of the village to the left.

_Edku_ (no hotel or café) stands on a high mound between the lake and
the Mediterranean. The houses in its steep streets are of red brick
strengthened with courses of palm and other woods; they anticipate the
more complicated architecture of Rosetta; there are some carved doors,
Italianate in style. Mosques, unimportant. On the top of the ridge are
some eight sailed windmills; they grind corn. Fine date palms grow on
the sand dunes towards the sea, for there is fresh water just beneath
the surface. There is an interesting local weaving industry, chiefly of
silk, imported in its rough state from China. The work rooms are
generally on the upper floors of the houses, and reached by an outside
staircase. Quiet pleasant places; on the walls of some are Cufic
inscriptions, inlaid in brick. The weavers sit to their looms in small
oval pits; they have the hands of craftsmen and produce on their simple
wooden machinery fabrics that are both durable and beautiful.

Fish are caught in Lake Edku. Some of the fishermen wade far into
shallow waters; there is also a fleet of boats which moor to the long
wooden jetty by the station. Occasional flamingoes.

The railway continues between lake and sea, finally bending northward
and curving round great groves of palm trees, behind which lie the town
of Rosetta and the river Nile.


                                ROSETTA.


Rosetta and Alexandria are rivals; when one rises the other declines.
Rosetta, situated on the Nile, would have dominated but for an
overwhelming drawback: she has, and can have, no sea-harbour, because
the coast in this part of Egypt is mere delta; the limestone ridges that
created the two harbours of Alexandria do not continue eastward of
Aboukir. Alexandria required organising by human science, but once
organised she was irresistible. It is only in an unscientific age that
Rosetta has been important. Let us briefly examine the birth and death,
rebirth and decay, of civilisation here.

    (i). In Pharaonic times the town and river-port of _Bolbitiné_ were
    built hereabouts—probably a little up stream, beyond the present
    mosque of Abou Mandour. Nothing is known of the history of
    Bolbitiné. When Alexandria was founded (B.C. 331) traffic deserted
    the “Bolbitiné” mouth of the Nile for the “Canopic” and for the
    Alexandrian harbours, and the town decayed consequently. Its chief
    memorial is the so-called “Rosetta Stone,” a basalt inscription now
    in the British Museum. The inscription enumerates the merits of King
    Ptolemy V Epiphanes (B.C. 196; see genealogical tree p. 12). It is a
    dull document, a copy of the original decree which was set up at
    Memphis and reproduced broadcast over the country. But it is
    important because it is written in three scripts—Hieroglyphic,
    Demotic and Greek—and thus led to the deciphering of the ancient
    Egyptian language. The antique columns &c. that may be seen in
    Rosetta to-day also probably came from Bolbitiné. But it was never
    important, and the sands have now covered it.

    (ii). _Rosetta_ itself was founded in A.D. 870 by El Motaouakel, one
    of the Abbaside Caliphs of Egypt. The date is most significant. By
    870 the Canopic mouth of the Nile had dried up, and isolated
    Alexandria from the Egyptian water system. Shipping passed back to
    the Bolbitiné mouth, and frequented it again for nearly a thousand
    years. “El Raschid” as the Arabs named the new settlement, became
    the western port of Egypt, Damietta being the eastern. It was
    important in the Crusades; St. Louis of France (1049) knew it as
    “Rexi.” In the 17th and 18th centuries it was practically rebuilt in
    its present form; the mosques, dwelling houses, cisterns, the great
    warehouses for grain that line the river bank, all date from this
    period, it evolved an architectural style, suitable to the locality.
    The chief material is brick, made from the Nile mud, and coloured
    red or black, there was no limestone to hand, such as supplied
    Alexandria: with the bricks are introduced courses of palm wood,
    antique columns &c. and a certain amount of mashrabiyeh work and
    faience. The style is picturesque rather than noble and may be
    compared with the brick style of the North German Hansa towns.
    Examples of it are to be found throughout the Delta and even in
    Alexandria herself (p. 125), but Rosetta is its head quarters. In
    architecture, as in other matters, the town kept in touch with
    Cairo; an Oriental town, scarcely westernised even to-day. So long
    as Alexandria lay dormant, it flourished; at the beginning of the
    19th century its population was 35,000, that of Alexandria 5,000.

    In 1798 Napoleon’s troops took Rosetta, in 1801 the British and
    Turks retook it, in 1807 the reconnoitring expedition of General
    Frazer (p. 89) was here repulsed. These events, unimportant in
    themselves, were the prelude to an irreparable disaster: the revival
    of Alexandria, on scientific lines, by Mohammed Ali. As soon as he
    developed the harbours there and restored the connection with the
    Nile water systems by cutting the Mahmoudieh Canal, (p. 91), Rosetta
    began to decay exactly as Bolbitiné had decayed two thousand years
    before. The population now is 14,000 as against Alexandria’s
    400,000, and it has become wizen and puny through inbreeding. The
    warehouses and mosques are falling down, the costly private
    dwellings of the merchants have been gutted, and the sand, advancing
    from the south and from the west, invades a little farther every
    year through the palm groves and into the streets. One can wander
    aimlessly for hours (it is best thus to wander) and can see nothing
    that is modern, nor anything more exciting than the arrival of the
    fishing fleet with sardines. It is the East at last, but the East
    outwitted by science, and in the last stages of exhaustion.

The main street of Rosetta starts from the Railway Station and runs due
south, parallel to the river, so it is easy to find one’s way. In it is
the only hotel, kept by a Greek; those who are not fastidious can sleep
here: the rest must manage to see the sights between trains. The hotel
has a pleasant garden, overlooked by the minaret of a mosque.

In the main street, to the right;—_Mosque of Ali-el-Mehalli_, built
1721, but containing the tomb of the Saint, who died in the 16th
century. A large but uninteresting building, with an entrance porch in
the “Delta” style—bricks arranged in patterns, pendentives, &c.

Further down, to the left, by the covered bazaars: Entrance with old
doors to a large ruined building, probably once an “okel” or courtyard
for travellers and their animals; one can walk through it and come out
the other side through a fine portal, in the direction of the river. All
this part of the town is most picturesque. The houses are four or five
stories high, and have antique columns fantastically disposed among
their brickwork. The best and oldest example of this domestic
architecture is the _House of Ali-el-Fatairi_, in the Haret el-Ghazl,
with inscriptions above its lintels that date it 1620: its external
staircase leads to two doors, those of the men’s and women’s apartments
respectively. Other fine houses are those of:—Cheikh Hassan el Khabbaz
in Rue Dahliz el Molk; Osman Agha, at some cross roads,—carved wood
inside, date 1808; Ahmed Agha in the Chareh el Ghabachi to the west of
the town, invaded by sand.

At the end of the main street is the most important building in the
town, the _Mosque of Zagloul_. It really consists of two mosques: the
western was founded about 1600 by Zagloul, the Mamaluke or body-servant
of Said Hassan; the other and more ruinous section is the mosque of El
Diouai. There is a courtyard with fountain in centre. The entire mass
measures about 80 by 100 yds. All is brick except the two stone
minarets; the ruined one was “cut with scissors” according to local
opinion, but according to archaeology fell in the early 19th cent. The
sanctuary of the Mosque of Zagloul proper is a stupendous hall; over 300
columns, many of them antique, are arranged in six parallel rows, there
are four praying niches, three of them elaborately decorated, there is
the tomb of the ex-body-servant himself, now worshipped as a saint and
wooed by votive offerings of boats, and, in the tomb, his former master,
the Said Hassan, lies with him, and shares his honours. The sanctuary is
ruinous and carelessly built, but its perspective effects, especially
from the south wall, near the tomb, are very fine and rival those of the
Mosque of El Azhar at Cairo. Light enters through openings in the roof.

East of the Mosque of Zagloul and close to the river is the Mosque of
_Mohammed el Abbas_, date 1809, of superior construction but on the same
style; it has, unlike the other mosques of Rosetta, a fine dome,
covering the tomb of the saint.

Other Mosques:—Toumaksis Mosque, built by Saleh Agha Toumaksis in 1694;
it is reached up steps; fine iron work round the key holes; there is a
good pulpit inside, also tiles, and the prayer niche retains its
original geometrical decoration of hexagons and “Solomon’s
seals.”—Mosque of Cheikh Toka, which stands in an angle of the Chareh
Souk el Samak el Kadim; portal in “Delta” style with rosace over its
arches; inside, pulpit dated 1727.

About a mile to the south of the town, best reached by boat, is the
_Mosque of Abou Mandour_, a showy modern building, well placed on the
bend of the river bank, and backed by huge sand hills that threaten to
bury it, as they have buried Bolbitiné.

North of the town, and half-way between it and the sea, is the site of
Fort St. Julien, which Napoleon’s soldiers built, and where they
discovered the Rosetta Stone. The Fort has disappeared; there is a
sketch of it in the Alexandria Museum (Vestibule).

Sailing on the Nile: delightful.

                             SECTION VIII.

                                -------

                           THE LIBYAN DESERT.


ROUTES:—By the Mariout Railway to Bahig for Abousir and for St. Menas;
each expedition takes a day.

By Railway _via_ Tel-el-Baroud and Khatatbeh to the Wady Natrun; 2 or 3
days.


Alexandria, though so cosmopolitan, lies on the verge of civilisation.
Westward begins an enormous desert of limestone that stretches into the
heart of Africa. The very existence of this desert is forgotten by most
of the dwellers in the city, but it has played a great part in her
history, especially in Christian times, and no one who would understand
her career can ignore it.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The Mariout Railway was originally the property of the ex-Khedive. The
line starts from the central station and diverges from the main line at
Hadra. Having passed Nouzha station (Section IV) it crosses the
Mahmoudieh Canal (p. 91) then bends westward along the edge of Lake
Mariout. Just before Gabbari Garden station is a fishing village built
on a tiny creek and quite Japanese in appearance. It is worth going down
here when there has been a catch: the lake fish are uncanny monsters.
The neighbourhood is very fertile—palms bananas and vegetable gardens.
But it does not make pleasant walking owing to the smells.

                  *       *       *       *       *

MEX STATION. (Section VI). The train crosses the western or Mellaha arm
of Mariout. Right, are the salt pans that turn dull purple and red in
the summer beyond them the white spur of limestone that divides lake
from sea.

                  *       *       *       *       *

ABD EL KADER STATION. Now we approach the Libyan desert. The scenery and
the people change. From the hill to the right, by the tomb, is a fine
view, and wonderful colour effects in the evening.

                  *       *       *       *       *

AMRIEH STATION. This large village was formerly head of the Eastern
district of the Western Desert Province, but the Administration is
transferring to Burg el Arab. Bedouins come to the train, bigger and
wirier than the Egyptians, and more graceful; they wear rough white
robes and soft dark red tarbooshes.—There is a fine walk from Amrieh to
Mex—the best day’s tramp near Alexandria. The path leads north from the
station, by the communal gardens, then makes for a ridge where limestone
is quarried. View from the top over the western arm of Mariout. Take the
causeway that crosses the lake and on the further bank turn to the
right, finally crossing the coastal ridge to Dekhela (Section VI) and so
to Mex by the sea shore.

                  *       *       *       *       *

IKINGI MARIOUT STATION. (Ikingi is Turkish for “second.”)—A good centre
for the wild flowers of February and March. Go northward towards the
lake, and keep to the lower ground; the local flora is one of the finest
in the world.

                  *       *       *       *       *

BAHIG STATION.—Centre for two fine expeditions—Abousir on the coast, and
St. Menas inland.


                                ABOUSIR.


The ruins of Abousir lie 5½ miles N.W. from Bahig station. They can be
found without a guide. (_see_ map). There is a good road as far as Bahig
village (¾ mile). Just above the village is a big quarry, worked in
ancient times and very picturesque. A path crosses the ridge rather to
the left of this quarry, after which the ruins are in sight all the way.
The end of Mariout has to be crossed, so the expedition should not be
made in winter on account of the mud. The last half hour of the journey
is magnificent. The Temple and the Tower stand out on the height, which
is golden with marigolds in spring time; and near the top of the ascent
the sea appears through a gap, deep blue, and beating against a beach of
snowy sand. The flowers can be amazing, colouring the earth in every
direction. The ruins are supposed by the Bedouins to be the palace of
Abou Zeit; they really mark the Ptolemaic city of Taposiris, whose name
is preserved in the modern Abousir.

_Taposiris_ must have been built soon after Alexandria (about 300 B.C.),
and it is instructive to compare the two towns. They stand on the same
spur—Taposiris at its base, where it has emerged from the mass of the
desert. The lake is to their south, the sea to their north, so each
commanded two harbours, to the advantage of their trade. Each has a
lighthouse, each worshipped Osiris. Little is known of the history of
Taposiris—called the “Great” to distinguish it from “Little” Taposiris
at Montazah (p. 175). Its immediate trade was with the lake, its
sea-harbour being ½ mile below, at the vanished port of Plinthinus. The
Arabs turned the Temple of Osiris into a fortress, and in modern times
coast guards have been installed here.


[Illustration: ABOUSIR AND DISTRICT]


The Chief remains are:—

    (i). _Temple of Osiris._ The eastern, and main, entrance adjoins the
    coast-guard station. At first sight it looks no more than a hole in
    a ruined wall, but it can easily be reconstructed. Each side of the
    entrance were Gate-towers (Pylons) like those of Edfu or Kom Ombo in
    Upper Egypt. Their bases project from the main wall, and up the face
    of each are two grooves for flag staffs, from whose tops crimson
    streamers floated. Staircases, reached from the inside, ascend each
    tower, and there are also two square rooms in the base of each.

    The enclosure—about 100 yards square—is in a terrible mess. The
    actual temple has disappeared. There must have been a colonnaded
    court with an altar in the middle, and beyond it the temple facade:
    on north and south of temple would have been other courts. The
    arrangements were Egyptian, but some of the workman were Greek;
    mason marks with Greek letters (e.g. Alpha Kappa Rho) have been
    found on the stone in the boundary wall.

    The north boundary wall of the enclosure is very fine; it projects
    over the slope of the hill and rests on substructures: in it is a
    gate for the descent to the sea. Note the projections in the
    masonry. In the north west corner are some architectural fragments,
    piled up by the Arabs. (ii). _Lighthouse._ The ruined tower on the
    hill to the east of the temple was once mistaken for a tomb, since
    it stands in the ancient cemetery. It is really the Ptolemaic
    lighthouse of Taposiris, first of a chain that stretched from the
    Pharos at Alexandria all down the North African coast to Cyrene. It
    has, like the Pharos, three stages: a square basement, an octagonal
    central stage and a cylindrical top. On the north, where the outer
    wall of the octagon has fallen, one can see the marks of the
    staircase by which the wood was carried to the top—a simpler version
    of the double spiral that ascended the huge Alexandrian building.
    There can be no doubt that the Taposiris lighthouse was modelled on
    its gigantic contemporary—scale about ⅒th—and it is thus of great
    importance to archaeologists and historians. (_see_ throughout p.
    133).

    There are tombs close to the lighthouse, and tombs and houses all
    along the slope to the south of the temple.

    (iii). _Causeway._ South of the town, in the bed of the lake, are
    traces of the embankment that connected with the desert. It was
    doubtless pierced with arches like the Heptastadion at Alexandria,
    to allow boats to go through.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The other point of interest in the district is _Burg el Arab_ (Modern
Bahig). It lies some miles west of Bahig village (_see_ above) but is
easily located by the tower of the new carpet factory. Here is to be the
capital of the Eastern District of the Western Desert Province Frontier
Districts Administration; it is being planned and executed with great
taste, thanks mainly to the genius of the Officer Commanding, W. E.
Jennings Bramly, M.C. The factory consists of a great cloister and of
two halls, one each side of the big tower. Fragments of antique
sculpture and architecture have been cleverly introduced. The carpets
are woven from camels’ and goats’ hair by Bedouin and Senussi women—the
industry was started at Amrieh, during the late war. Specimens can be
had in the Alexandrian shops. Further to the west other buildings are
rising, including a small walled town. It is all most interesting, and
one of the few pieces of modern creative work to be seen in these parts.


                               ST. MENAS.


Seven and a half miles south of Bahig Station, in the loneliness of the
desert, lie the ruins of a great Christian city. They can be visited
between trains on a good horse, but it is better to camp out. The track
passes over gently undulating expanses of limestone. The scenery grows
less interesting, the flora scarcer, as the coast is left behind. At
last the monotony is broken by the square hut where the excavators used
to live. The ancient name of the place is preserved in the
modern—Abumna.


[Illustration: ST. MENAS - PLAN I.
The Sanctuary Group_
Subterranean work thus .........]


Menas, a young Egyptian officer, was martyred during his service in Asia
Minor because he would not abandon Christ (A.D. 296). When the army
moved back into Egypt his friends brought his ashes with them, and at
the entrance of the Lybian Desert a miracle took place: the camel that
was carrying the burden refused to go further. The saint was buried and
forgotten. But a shepherd observed that a sick lamb that crossed the
spot became well. He tried successfully with another lamb. Then a sick
princess was healed. The remains were exhumed, and a church built over
the grave.

This church can still be traced. It is the Basilica of the Crypt (Plan I
p. 196) date 350, to which, at the end of the century, an immense
extension was added by the Emperor Arcadius. What caused so rapid a
growth? Water. There were springs in the limestone that have since dried
up, and that must have had curative powers. Baths were built, some of
them opening out of a church (Plan II). Little flasks, stamped with the
Saint’s image, were filled from the sacred source by his tomb. The
environs were irrigated, houses, walls, cemeteries built, until in the
pure air a sacred city sprang up, where religion was combined with
hygiene. Nor did the saint only protect invalids. He was also the patron
of the caravans that passed by him from Alexandria to the Wady Natrun,
the Siwan Oasis, and Tripoli, and so he is always seen between two
camels, who crouch in adoration because he guides them aright. By the
6th century he had become god of the Lybian Desert, then less deserted
than now, and his fame, like that of his predecessor Serapis, had
travelled all round the Mediterranean, and procured him worshippers as
far as Rome and France.

Islam checked the cult. But as late as the year 1,000, an Arab traveller
saw the great double basilica still standing. Lights burned in the
shrine night and day, and there was still left a little trickle of “the
beautiful water of St. Menas that drives away pain.”

The site, entirely forgotten, was discovered in 1905. It has been
carefully excavated. Little more than the ground plans of the buildings
remain, but they are most interesting, and the marble decorations
delightful.


[Illustration: ST. MENAS – PLAN II.
The Sacred Baths]


_The Sanctuary Group._ This lies a little to the south of the
excavators’ huts. Combined length, nearly 400 ft. In the centre is the
original church covering the tomb. To its east is the impressive
addition of Arcadius; to its west a baptistery. On its north side a
monastery. The best view of the group is from a mound outside the
baptistery. The general arrangement is quite clear. (Plan I, p. 196).
Taken in detail:—

    (i). _Church of Arcadius._—Length nearly 200 feet. A cruciform
    basilica with a nave and two aisles, and aisled transepts. Over the
    intersection was a dome, beneath which, now much ruined by its fall,
    is the High Altar. Behind the altar are curved steps that supported
    the ecclesiastical throne. Both altar and throne are in a square
    enclosure where the priests and singers stood; a narrow alley
    connects it with the nave. The eastern apse has been used for
    burials.

    The Nave is paved with white marble from the Greek archipelago.
    Green and purple marbles (verde antico and porphyry) were also used.
    From its south aisle, three doors open into a fine atrium. This was
    the principal approach to the church. The north aisle opens—at its
    east end—on to a staircase that ascended to the roof of the church;
    the other doors to the monks’ apartments and hospice (_see_ below).
    The west end of the nave is irregular, because the apse of the
    primitive church impinges.

    (ii). _Primitive Church._ A small, three-aisled basilica, not well
    preserved, but with interesting crypt. The descent to this is by a
    marble staircase that starts in the Arcadian church, passes by a
    portico with a vaulted roof of brick, and then, after a little,
    turns to the south into an oblong subterranean chamber. Here, amid
    rich decorations, the ashes of the young saint once lay, is a tomb
    that was probably visible from the church above. A bas-relief of him
    was fixed to the south wall; the place for the marble slab can still
    be seen there. The ugly bas-relief in the Alexandria Museum (Room I)
    is a copy. Attached to the crypt is a chapel once vaulted with gold
    mosaic; the well in it was made by treasure-hunters.

    On the west of the church runs the sacred water course from which
    the sanctuary derived its fame. It is a subterranean cistern, over
    80 yards long; a shaft was sunk into it from the nave. Passing, as
    it did, so near to the saint’s remains, it had special sanctity. The
    water was used to fill flasks, and also in the adjacent Baptistery.

    (iii). _The Baptistery_ is square without and octagonal within. In
    its centre, down steps, is the chief font, which had an over-flow
    canal; we do not know how it was filled. The floor was richly inlaid
    with serpentine, porphyry and other marbles. There was a dome. On
    its south side is an atrium. On its western exterior, niches for
    statues.

    A Baptistery of this type—separate from the rest of the church—is
    common enough in the West. But in the East it is unique. Only at St.
    Menas, where water was so prominent in the worship, does it occur.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Immediately to the north of the Sanctuary Group are the _Monastery
Buildings and Hospice_, a confused labyrinth. Best is a hall paved with
marble and one supported by eight columns. It lies 40 yards due north
from the gate of the Primitive Church. These buildings, together with
the Sanctuary Group that they served, cover an area of over 40,000
square yards.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_The Sacred Baths_ (Plan II). About 80 yards from the Monastery
Buildings. Best located by the fine circular cistern of well-cut
limestone blocks. The main building has a heating apparatus and three
baths. Also a small but finely finished church; basilica type; apses at
each end; three aisles. Two baths open straight out of its south aisles,
and in its nave are two marble fountains that were probably filled from
the source in the central sanctuary (_see_ above). Throughout the
arrangements are significant. The line between the hygienic and the
miraculous is nowhere clearly drawn; heating apparatus and church have
each to play their parts. Date of the group, probably 5th century.
Another group lies beyond.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_Northern Cemetery._—This, the most important in the city, is some way
from the groups above described. Indeed the visitor from Bahig leaves it
to his left on his way to the hut. There is a good view of it from a
mound. The main object is a church (150 ft. long), with three aisles, a
square apse and numerous mortuary chapels where the more prominent
invalids were buried. Others lie outside. Late date—7th-9th cent.

This by no means catalogues the ruins of St. Menas. There is a Southern
Cemetery, private houses, wine presses, a kiln where the terra cotta
flasks were made. All the desert around shows remains of the curious
cult, which in some ways anticipated the methods of Lourdes.

Half a day over the desert southward brings a rider to the Wady Natrun.


                            THE WADY NATRUN.


The Wady is best visited by arrangement with the Egyptian Salt and Soda
Company, who have the concession for developing that section of it where
the Lakes and the Monasteries lie. The Company’s private railway starts
at Khatatbeh, on the branch line between Cairo and Tel-el-Baroud (_see_
Map. p. 174). The train curves up the desert to Bir Victoria, where it
waters beneath a solitary tree. Then it leaves civilisation, and for
three hours nothing is seen except an occasional gazelle. At the end of
that time the ground falls away to the left, and the monastery of St.
Macarius appears far off. Then is seen the chain of the lakes, and
across them, often in mirage, the monasteries of St. Pschoi and The
Syrians. The train descends to the terminus of Bir Hooker, close to the
Company’s factory and rest house.

                  *       *       *       *       *

The Wady Natrun (_i.e_. Natron, Soda) is a curious valley that begins
near Cairo, and slopes north-westward into the heart of the Lybian
Desert. It may have once been an outlet of the Nile, though it is barred
now from the sea by coastal hills. Its upper and lower reaches are both
barren, but in the central section—that which the railway taps—water
survives in the form of a chain of mineral lakes.

The deposits were worked from antiquity, but with the rise of
monasticism the Wady took a new importance, owing to its discomfort. As
early as A.D 150 St. Fronto retreated here from Alexandria. St. Ammon
followed in 270; St. Macarius or Mercury a hundred years later. The more
moderate ascetics extracted soda with the assistance of laymen; the
extremists sought a waterless stretch called Scetis—probably the
southern portion of the valley where the monastery to St. Macarius still
stands. There were soon 5,000 monks. It is natural that so remote a
community should lose touch with the theological niceties of the
capital, and in 399 the Patriarch Theophilus was obliged to rebuke the
monks for minimising the divine element in the Second Person. Their
reply was startling. They crossed the desert, stormed Alexandria, and
made the Patriarch apologise. A few years later he led an army into the
Wady to punish them, but by now, oddly enough, they had veered to the
opposite error; they minimised the human element. The truth is they
represented native Egypt, the Patriarch the Hellenising coast. (_see_ p.
51). The quarrel was racial rather than theological, and when in the 6th
century it came to a head, the Wady became the natural stronghold of the
national or Monophysite party who, under the name of Copts, worship
there to this day.

With the 19th century came a new colony—the industrial. It is the
factory chimney of the Salt and Soda Company that now dominates the
scene. The lakes are dredged for their deposits. The chief product is
caustic soda which is poured red hot into metal drums, and exported all
over the east. Ordinary soda (natron) is also produced. The factory is
interesting. It, and the surrounding settlement, are due in their
present form to Mr. A. H. Hooker, after whom the settlement is named.

More than eighty different species of birds have been identified in the
marshes surrounding Bir Hooker.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_The Mineral Lakes._

These lie between the factory and the monasteries. Some of them are
squalid, others are indescribably beautiful, especially in summer. The
deposits form at the bottom. As they reach the top, the lake seems to be
covered with white and crimson ice, in the midst of which are pools of
blue and green water, and trickling streams of claret, and tracts that
blush like a rose. When the scene is in mirage, its strangeness passes
belief. A bird looks as big as a man, and the lump of salt it perches on
shows like a boat of snow. The finest of these lakes is just to the left
of Bir Hooker.

                  *       *       *       *       *

_The Monasteries._

Four of these survive, and there are the ruins of many others. They are
all of the same type, and to avoid repetitions it may be thus
summarised:

                  *       *       *       *       *

Exterior:—an enclosure of stone laid in the middle of the desert,
covering about an acre. Palm trees and buildings show over its walls.
The walls are blank except for one high arch, which indicates the
position of a little door, the only entrance. The black-robed monks,
when the bell has been rung, look down from the parapet, then unbar the
door, and take the traveller to the Guest House for coffee and lemonade.
They are dirty and ignorant, but most courteous and hospitable. All
payment is refused.

                  *       *       *       *       *

In the enclosure:—two or three churches, normally consisting of nave,
choir, and sanctuary (kaikal). Refectory. Sleeping cells for the monks.
Mill for grinding corn. Oven, where is baked the hard brown bread, and
also the “isbodikon” (somatikon, sacrament), a cake of fine flour
beautifully stamped with a cross and used for the Eucharist. Olive
press. Granary. Garden of palm trees, bananas, capsicums, etc. Keep
(kasr) for final retreat when attacked; reached only by a drawbridge
from the parapet of the wall; contains library, dungeons, chapels;
usually dedicated to St. Michael.

                  *       *       *       *       *

Date: general appearance and arrangement are of the 6th century. Most of
the details are later.

Extract from the Thanksgiving offered at the arrival of a distinguished
visitor:—

    He who visits these mansions with firm faith, fervent desire, true
    repentance and good works, shall have all his sins forgiven. Then, O
    my reverend fathers and my beloved brethren, come that we may pray
    for these our dear and honourable brethren, who are come upon this
    visit and have reached these habitations, let us pray that Jesus
    Christ, who was with his servants in every time and every place, may
    now be with them, and may deliver them from all sins and iniquities.
    May he grant them the best of gifts and full reward, recompensing
    them for all that they have endured through toil and peril and the
    weariness of the journey as they travelled hither; giving them
    abundance of blessing; bring them back to their homes in safety; and
    after long life transport them to the brightness of Paradise and the
    life of bliss, through the intercession of Our Lady the Virgin, and
    of all our holy fathers. Amen.[7]

Footnote 7:

      From A. J. Butler’s Ancient Coptic Churches.


                  *       *       *       *       *

THE FOUR MONASTERIES.

    (A). _Convent of St. Pschoi_ (Deir Abou Bishoi). About an hour’s
    ride from Bir Hooker. Dedicated to St. Pschoi or Besa. “B” is the
    Coptic article, so the saint’s name is ultimately “Isa” _i.e._
    Isaiah. Little is known about him.

    The convent enclosure contains:

        (i). _The Church of St. Pschoi_ (Plan I, p. 202). 6th-11th
        cents. with later additions. A spacious entrance porch leads to
        the dark but impressive interior. There are three divisions:
        Nave, Choir and Sanctuary.

        The Nave has an arched vault; massive piers with pointed arches
        divide it from its aisles. In it is an Ambon (lectern for
        reading the Gospel), and a small marble basin level with the
        floor, where the priest washes the feet of the people on Maundy
        Thursday in commemoration of the action of Christ. Many of the
        Nave arches have been blocked up to strengthen the building.
        High and narrow folding doors—recalling a Japanese screen—close
        the lofty arch that leads from the Nave into the Choir; they are
        set with fine carved panels, enclosed in ivory borders. Other
        doors lead from the aisles.

        The Choir too has vaulting, but it is at right angles to that of
        the Nave. At each side of the Choir are chapels, probably of
        later date. Left—Chapel of the Virgin, with a chest containing
        the relics of St. Pschoi, whom the monks state remains intact.
        Right—Chapel of St. Ischyrion; off it is the Baptistery. The
        entrance into the Sanctuary is through ancient carved doors;
        over them is a triumphant arch.

        The Sanctuary has, behind the altar, a fine tribune of six
        steps—three straight and three curved. In the centre was the
        throne of the Abbot. It has gone, and the marble decorations of
        the steps are ruined. Above the throne is a marble mosaic. In
        the centre of the eastern dome is a Cross.

        (ii). _The Refectory._—This solemn room contains the immense
        stone table, narrow and low, at which the monks break their
        yearly fast. They do not eat here usually, and use the table as
        a drying place for onions, bread, etc., while cakes of salt are
        stacked against the wall. At the head of the table is the
        Abbot’s seat. The place is rough and indescribably untidy. But
        one could scarcely find a more striking relic of primitive
        Christianity.

    (B). _Convent of the Syrians_ (Deir es Suriani).—Close to the
    Convent of St. Pschoi. Founded by monks from Syria. Dedicated to the
    Virgin. Here Robert Curzon (1833) discovered in the oil cellar
    priceless Syrian, Coptic, and Abyssinian MSS., now in the British
    Museum. He describes his find in “Monasteries of the Levant”: it was
    facilitated by plying the Abbot with liqueurs. More were brought
    away by Archdeacon Tattam, and nothing valuable remains now.

    The enclosure contains:—

        (i). _Church of the Virgin_ (Plan II, p. 203)—A fine building 40
        ft. by 90, probably the model for the church in St.
        Pschoi—_i.e_. originating in the 6th century.

        The Nave has piers with high pointed arches, and lofty vaulting,
        slightly pointed. In the middle, the basin for the Maundy feet
        washing, a marble slab with a circular depression. In the
        western semi-dome, fine fresco of the Ascension. Precious
        folding doors between nave and choir, inlaid with ivory panels
        of Christ in the nimbus of the Cross, the Virgin, St. Peter and
        St. Mark; round their posts and lintels a Syriac inscription,
        dating them back to the 7th century.

        The Choir—North semi-dome; fresco of the Death of the Virgin.
        South semi-dome; fresco of the Annunciation and Nativity.
        Admirable work. More ancient doors between Choir and Sanctuary;
        ivory panel representing Dioscurus (Patriarch of Alexandria 450
        and founder of Monophysism _see_ p. 51), Mark, Emmanuel, the
        Virgin, Ignatius, and Severus (512). Syriac inscriptions of
        rather later type—8th century.

        Sanctuary. Skilful and effective plaster frieze with a border
        below and panels of conventional trees and vines above. Above
        the eastern niche a panel of crosses. This unique decoration
        should be studied closely.

        (ii). _Smaller Church of the Virgin._ Over its entrance to the
        south-west a marble cross in low relief. Inside, another cross
        in black marble. Probably dedication crosses. Pulpit in the
        choir.

        (iii). _Tamarind tree under the enclosing wall._ St. Ephraim the
        Syrian (date 373) inadvertently, so they say, laid his staff
        down, and it took root at once. But it is unlikely that St.
        Ephraim ever visited Egypt.

                  *       *       *       *       *

    (C). Convent of St. Baramus (Deir el Baramus). About two hours ride
    from Bir Hooker. Dedicated to an unknown saint (Romaios?).

    In the enclosure are:—

        (i). _Church of the Virgin._ The piers of the nave are built
        round antique marble columns. There are ten dedication crosses,
        marking places signed with holy oil at the consecration of the
        church—six in the nave and four in the choir. Fine carvings on
        the sanctuary screen. In the reliquary lie the brothers S.S.
        Maximus and Domitius from whose mouths, when they prayed, fiery
        ropes ascended to Heaven. Attached to this church are two
        smaller ones—St. George (Mari Girgis) now used as a granary; it
        has an ornamented dome—and St. Theodore (Al Amir Tadrus).

        (ii). _Church of Baramus_, ruined by restoration.

        (iii). _The Refectory_—similar to that at St. Pschoi. Date 5th
        or 6th century. At this entrance is a great book-rest of stone.

        (iv). _Keep_, with chapel to St. Michael.

    (D). _Convent of St. Macarius_ (Deir Abou Makar).

    This monastery is the least accessible of the four, being ten miles
    from Bir Hooker.

    St. Macarius, or Mercury, the founder, was an Alexandrian who was
    seen by another saint in a vision killing the apostate Emperor
    Julian (d. 363). He is also celebrated for a bunch of grapes that he
    refused to eat, and for a mosquito that he killed. Overcome with
    remorse at its death, he retired naked to the marshes near, and at
    the end of six months was so distended by stings that the brethren
    could only recognise him by his voice. He selected this site for his
    monastery on account of the badness of the communications and water
    supply. It was repaired in 880. Of its later history nothing is
    known.

    The monastery enclosure is on the usual plan. It contains:—

        (i). _Church of Macarius._ Byzantine in character; three
        sanctuaries, a choir, and an irregular western end. The central
        sanctuary is roofed by a fine brick dome, once covered with
        frescoes, and still showing traces of its ancient windows, with
        their stucco partitions and tiny panels of coloured glass. There
        were also frescoes in the eastern niche, and paintings upon the
        entrance arch. The sanctuary doors are well carved.

        Left of Sanctuary: Chapel of St. John, with a double screen. The
        outer screen is set with exquisitely carved panels—probably 8th
        century. Frame later. The plaster of the dome has fallen; it too
        was once coloured. St. Macarius lies in the Reliquary.

        (ii). _Church of the Elders_ (Al Shiulah), marked by a detached
        bell-tower. A small building of similar plan. One of its columns
        has a late classical capital.

        (iii). _Church of St. Ischyrion_ (Abou Iskharun)—one of the
        martyrs whom Alexandria, in the past, so freely produced. A
        magnificent low-pitched dome almost covers both choir and nave.
        It is made of bricks that must have been carried on camels from
        the Delta.

        (iv). _The Keep_ (Kasr), reached by a flight of steps and a
        drawbridge. On its first floor are three chapels dedicated to:—

        St. Michael—Corinthian and Doric capitals in the nave; the
        Sanctuary Screen has ivory inlay; in the Sanctuary are the
        bodies of sixteen patriarchs, each in a plain deal box: St.
        Anthony—three ancient frescoed figures: and St. Suah, with more
        frescoes. On the ground floor, a chapel to the Virgin, with a
        triple altar containing depressions of unknown use.

                              APPENDIX I.

                   THE MODERN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES.


The ecclesiastical life of Alexandria is not as intense to-day as in the
days of St. Athanasius, but it is even more complicated. The city is the
seat of four patriarchates, and many other religious bodies are
represented in her. The complications are partly due to the activity of
Roman Catholicism, which, in order to win oriental schismatics back to
the fold, has in each case created a counter church that shall
approximate as nearly as possible to the conditions and ritual that are
familiar—_e.g._ an Armenian Catholic Church for the Armenians, a Coptic
Catholic for the Copts. And further complications proceed from the
modern, commercial communities who tend to regard religion as an
expression of nationality rather than of dogma.

The following list of the Churches may indicate the unsuspected vastness
of the subject:—

GREEK PATRIARCHATE: “Orthodox Greek,” or “Melchite” church (from Melek,
Arabic for King). Present Patriarch, Photius I. His position is curious.
He is a subject neither to the Kingdom of Greece, nor to the Patriarch
of Constantinople, but holds, or rather held, his position from the
Sultan of Turkey direct. Thus ecclesiastically he is independent. His
title is “Patriarch of Alexandria, Lybia, Pentapolis, Ethiopia, and all
Egypt,” but his patriarchate does not extend beyond Egypt, which he
administers through four bishops. Historically he represents the church
that kept loyal to Byzantium and to the Emperor at the Council of
Chalcedon (A.D. 451) when the rest of Egypt began to drift away over the
Monophysite question. After the Arab Conquest the Greek Patriarch
resided in Cairo, but came back to Alexandria about sixty years ago to
the Convent and Church of St. Saba. (p. 106). As for dogma, the Greek
Orthodox chiefly differs from the Roman Catholic and the Protestants
over the “Filioque” clause in the Nicene creed. It holds that the Holy
Ghost proceeded not from the Father and the Son, but through the Son.
This is the point over which the East and West split, and failed to
reunite in 1459.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHURCHES OF THE GREEK COMMUNITY: These too are Greek Orthodox in faith.
But they do not recognise the Patriarch. Indeed their relations with him
during the late war were of the liveliest. They are the churches of a
body of business men who only owe allegiance to the Kingdom of Greece.
They are self-administering, and choose their own priests. The Patriarch
however, has the right of examining those priests’ credential, and of
giving them permission to officiate. The Community has a Cathedral (The
Annunciation) near the Place St. Catherine (p. 142); also three churches
in Ramleh,—St. Stefano, St. Nicolas, and the Prophet Elias.

                  *       *       *       *       *

SYRIAN GREEK ORTHODOX: The Church of those members of the Syrian
Community who hold the Greek Orthodox faith. Independent of the
Patriarch. Under an archimandrite. Services in Arabic. Church—“Dormition
de la Sainte Vierge” in the Rue el Kaid Gohar.

This completes the Greek Orthodox Churches.

                  *       *       *       *       *

COPTIC PATRIARCHATE: The Copts are Monophysites—_i.e._ believe that
after the Incarnation the Divine and the Human in Christ were united
into a single nature. (p. 76). This severs them from the rest of
Christendom. Historically the Patriarchate is the opponent of the Greek
Orthodox Patriarchate, from whom it split at the Council of Chalcedon,
and it claims to represent Egyptian Christianity. In 960 the Patriarch
went to reside at Cairo, and the custom has continued, though the title
of “Patriarch of Alexandria” was retained: Besides his powers in Egypt,
the Patriarch consecrates the Metropolitan of Abyssinia. Alexandria has
a resident archbishop. Cathedral—in the Rue de l’Eglise Copte. (p. 160).

                  *       *       *       *       *

ARMENIAN CHURCH: Founded by St. Gregory the Illuminator in the 4th
Century, and, like the Coptic, Monophysite. Its head is a “Catholicos”
at Etchmiadzin, Armenia. The Alexandrian community has a church, SS.
Peter and Paul, Rue Abou el Dardaa. (p. 143).

                  *       *       *       *       *

We now come to the group of churches that are in communion with Rome.
Dogma, identical. Rite, differing.

LATIN PATRIARCHATE: Founded after the Crusades—13th century. The
Patriarch does not reside but lives at Rome, and governs through an
Apostolic Vicar who lives at Alexandria. Chief Church—Cathedral of St.
Catherine (Place St. Catherine). (p. 142).

                  *       *       *       *       *

COPTIC PATRIARCHATE: Organised in 1895, with title of “Patriarchate of
Alexandria and of all the Preaching of St. Mark.” The Patriarch resides
at Alexandria, and administers Egypt through the suffragan bishops of
Hermopolis Magna and Thebes. Cathedral—Rue de l’Hôpital Indigène. (p.
154).

                  *       *       *       *       *

GREEK CATHOLIC CHURCH: Under the Patriarch of Antioch who now lives at
Damascus and governs Alexandria through a Vicar General. Church: St.
Pierre, Rue Debbane. (p 160.). The priests generally officiate in
Arabic, though the ecclesiastical language is Greek.

                  *       *       *       *       *

MARONITE CHURCH: Founded in the 5th century by St. Maro, and at one time
adhering to the Monothelite heresy. This was a fainter version of the
Monophysite, and asserted that though Christ might have two natures, He
only had one will. (p. 77). The Catholic view is that Christ had two
wills, human and divine, which were exercised in unison, and in the 18th
century the Maronite Community subscribed to this, and is consequently
in communion with Rome. Patriarch at Antioch. Ecclesiastical
language—Syrian. Church at Alexandria in the Rue de l’Eglise Maronite.
(p. 140).

                  *       *       *       *       *

ARMENIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH: Under the Patriarchate of Cilicia, formed in
the 18th century. There is a Bishop of Alexandria, but he lives at
Cairo. Church—Rue Averoff. (p. 160).

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHALDEAN CATHOLIC CHURCH: Under the Patriarchate of Babylon, formed
1843, to counteract the Nestorian heresy. The Chaldeans of Alexandria,
100 strong, are said to be looking for a plot of ground on which to
build a church.

                  *       *       *       *       *

This concludes the Catholic group. As regards the Protestants:

UNITED PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF EGYPT: Most, but not all, native
Protestants belong to this body. It is attached to the American Mission,
which proselytizes mainly among the Copts. Church—Rue Tewfik I.

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHURCH OF ENGLAND: Alexandria is in the diocese of Egypt and the Sudan.
The official church of the British community is St. Marks in the Square,
built on land given to the community by Mohammed Ali. (p. 102). There is
another Anglican church at Ramleh (All Saints) built by some residents
there. Its living, after some heart-burnings, has been placed in the
hands of the Bishop of London. (p. 166).

                  *       *       *       *       *

CHURCH OF SCOTLAND: St. Andrew’s, in the French Gardens.

                              APPENDIX II.

                         THE DEATH OF CLEOPATRA

                                (p. 27).


The death of Cleopatra as described by Plutarch took hold of the
imagination of posterity, and was dramatised by Shakespeare and by
Dryden.

    (i). PLUTARCH. (in North’s Translation which Shakespeare used).

    Her death was very sodain. For those whom Caesar sent unto her ran
    thither in all haste possible, and found the soldiers standing at
    the gate, mistrusting nothing, nor understanding of her death. But
    when they had opened the doors, they found Cleopatra stark dead,
    laid upon a bed of gold, attired and arrayed in her royal robes, and
    one of her two women, which was called Iras, dead at her feet: and
    her other woman called Charmian half dead, and trembling, trimming
    the diadem which Cleopatra wore upon her head. One of the soldiers
    seeing her, angrily said to her: Is that well done, Charmian? Very
    well said she again, and meet for a princess descended of so many
    royal kings. She said no more, but fell down dead hard by the bed.

    (ii). SHAKESPEARE. (Antony and Cleopatra, Act V, Scene 2)

           _Cleopatra._ Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
        Immortal longings in me; now no more
        The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.
        Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
        Antony call; I see him rouse himself
        To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
        The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
        To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
        Now to that name my courage prove my title!
        I am fire and air; my other elements
        I give to baser life. So; have you done?
        Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
        Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
                                       (kisses them. Iras falls and dies).
        Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
        If thou and nature can so gently part,
        The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,
        Which hurts and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
        If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world
        It is not worth leave-taking.

           _Charmian._ Dissolve thick cloud and rain; that I may say
        The gods themselves do weep.

           _Cleopatra._                   This proves me base:
        If she meet first the curled Antony
        He’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
        Which is my heaven to have. Come thou mortal wretch
                             (to the asp, which she applies to her breast)
        With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
        Of life at once untie; poor venomous fool,
        Be angry, and despatch. O! couldst thou speak,
        That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
        Unpolicied.

           _Charmian._   O eastern star!

           _Cleopatra._                  Peace, peace!
        Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
        That sucks the nurse asleep?

           _Charmian._                    O, break! O, break!

           _Cleopatra._ As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle—
        O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too.
                                         (applying another asp to her arm)
        What should I stay—      (dies).

           _Charmian._ In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
        Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
        A lass unparallel’d. Downy windows, close;
        And golden Phœbus never be beheld
        Of eyes again so royal! Your crown’s awry;
        I’ll mend it, and then play.
                                             (enter the Guard, rushing in)

           _First Guard._ Where is the queen?

           _Charmian._ Speak softly, wake her not.

           _First Guard._ Caesar hath sent—

           _Charmian._                           Too slow a messenger.
                                                          (applies an asp)

        O! come apace, dispatch; I partly feel thee.

           _First Guard._ Approach, ho! All’s not well; Caesar’s
              beguil’d.

           _Second Guard._ There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

           _First Guard._ What work is this? Charmian, is this well
              done?

           _Charmian._ It is well done and fitting for a princess
        Descended of so many royal kings.
        Ah! Soldier.
                                                                    (dies)


    (iii). DRYDEN. (All for Love, Act. V Scene I).

           _Charmian._                              To what end
        These ensigns of your Pomp and Royalty?

           _Cleopatra._ Dull that thou art! why, ’tis to meet my Love;
        As when I saw him first, on Cydno’s bank,
        All sparkling, like a goddess; so adorned,
        I’ll find him, once again: my second spousals
        Shall match my first in glory. Haste, haste, both,
        And dress the bride of Antony.

           _Charmian._                      ’Tis done.

          _Cleopatra._ Now set me by my lord. I claim this place:
        For I must conquer Caesar too, like him,
        And win my share o’ th’ world. Hail, you dear relics
        Of my immortal love!
          O let no impious hand remove you hence;
        But rest for ever here. Let Egypt give
        His death that peace, which it denied his life.
        Reach me the casket.

           _Iras._                Underneath the fruit
        The aspic lies.

                        Welcome, thou kind deceiver!

            _Cleopatra._
                                              (putting aside the leaves)

        Thou best of thieves; who, with an easy key,
        Dost open life, and, unperceived by us,
        Ev’n steal us from ourselves; discharging so
        Death’s dreadful office, better than himself,
        Touching our limbs so gently into slumber,
        That Death stands by, deceived by his own image,
        And thinks himself but sleep.

           _Serapion_ (within).            The Queen, where is she?
        The town is yielded, Caesar’s at the gates.

           _Cleopatra._ He comes too late t’invade the rights of death.
        Haste, bare my arm, and rouse the serpent’s fury.
                                  (holds out her arm, and draws it back)

        Coward flesh—
        Would’st thou conspire with Caesar to betray me,
        As thou wert none of mine? I’ll force thee to it
        And not be sent by him,
        But bring myself my soul to Antony.
                            (turns aside, and then shows her arm bloody)

        Take hence; the work is done.

           _Serapion_ (within).             Break ope the door
        And guard the traitor well.

           _Charmian._                   The next is ours.

           _Iras._ Now, Charmian, be too worthy
        Of our great queen and mistress.
                                                 (they apply the aspics)

           _Cleopatra._ Already, death, I feel thee in my veins;
        I go with such a will to find my lord,
        That we shall quickly meet.
        A heavy numbness creeps through every limb,
        And now ’tis at my head: my eyelids fail
        And my dear love is vanished in a mist.
        Where shall I find him, where? O turn me to him,
        And lay me on his breast—Caesar, thy worst;
        Now part us if thou canst.
                            (Dies. Iras sinks down at her feet and dies;
                            Charmian stands behind her chair as dressing
                           her head. Enter Serapion, two priests, Alexas
                                                      bound, Egyptians).

           _Two Priests._ Behold, Serapion, what havoc death hath made.

           _Serapion._ ’Twas what I feared. Charmian, is this well done?

           _Charmian._ Yes, ’tis well done, and like a queen, the last
        Of her great race: I follow her.
                                                     (sinks down; dies).

                             APPENDIX III.

                   THE UNCANONICAL GOSPELS OF EGYPT.

                                (p. 73).


    (i). FROM THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIANS.

    The Lord said unto Salome, who asked how long death would prevail,
    “As long as ye women bear children. I have come to undo the work of
    woman.” And Salome said “Then have I done well in that I have not
    born children.” The Lord answered and said “Eat every plant, but
    that which has bitterness eat not.” When Salome asked when would be
    known the things about which he spake (_i.e._ the Last Judgement)
    the Lord said “Whenever ye put off the garment of shame, when the
    two become one, and the male with the female, there being neither
    male nor female.”

    (ii). FROM THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE HEBREWS.

    Jesus saith:—“Let not him who seeks cease until he find and when he
    finds he shall be astonished; astonished, he shall reach the
    Kingdom, and having reached the Kingdom he shall rest.”

    (iii). FROM UNCERTAIN SOURCES (about 200 A.D.)

    Jesus saith:—“Except ye fast to the world, ye shall in no wise find
    the Kingdom of God; and except ye make the sabbath a real sabbath,
    ye shall not see the Father.”

    Jesus saith:—“Wherever there are two, they are not without God, and
    when ever there is one alone, I say, I am with him. Raise the stone
    and there thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there am I.”

                              APPENDIX IV.

                           THE NICENE CREED.

                            (pp. 49 and 75).


Here is the text as originally passed by the Council, including the
paragraph against the Arians; additions to the original texts are
enclosed within brackets.

We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things, both
visible and invisible.

And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father
(only begotten, that is to say of the substance of the Father) God of
God and Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being
of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made (both
things in Heaven and things on Earth); who for us men and for our
salvation came down and was made flesh, made man, suffered and rose
again on the third day, went up into the heavens and is to come again to
judge the quick and the dead;

And in the Holy Ghost;

But the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematises those who say
that there was a time when the Son of God was not, and that he was not
before he was begotten, and that he was made from that which did not
exist; or who assert that he is of other substance or essence than the
Father, or is susceptible of change.

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
